Also known as sakura, the cherry blossoms are not only a beautiful sight but hold deep cultural significance in Japan as well. They symbolize the transient nature of life and the beauty of impermanence.\nEvery spring, usually\nfrom late March to early April, cherry trees in Kyoto burst into beautiful pink and white blooms\n, creating a stunning landscape of delicate flowers. Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry blossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. Some gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical atmosphere.\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the fact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. However, with careful planning, you can make it happen! Thats why Ive put together this\nKyoto cherry blossom guide\n. Here youll find all the information Ive collected before and during my trip to Japan, including the exact sakura festival dates, night illuminations and the best cherry blossom spots.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Guide 2026\nSpring is magical in Kyoto. Every year,\nbetween late March and early April, thousands of cherry trees\ndecorate the citys ancient temples and serene gardens in beautiful pink and white colours. Its likely the most scenic time of year, but its fleeting,\nlasting just two weeks\n. Be sure to plan your visit carefully to catch it at its best.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Forecast 2026\nEvery year in January, the Japan Weather Association releases the cherry blossom forecast. This forecast provides information about when the flowers will begin to bloom and when they will reach full bloom across Japan.\nHowever, keep in mind that these dates are not final, because they depend a lot on the weather. Typically, if the weather is mild during the weeks before the sakura season, the trees tend to bloom earlier. Conversely, colder weather delays the blossoms from opening. The dates may shift either earlier or later (even up to 10 days), depending on weather conditions.\nIn recent years, the first blooms in Kyoto have been observed between March 17 and March 26. The full bloom typically reaches its peak between March 26 and April 4.\nThis year,\nthe first cherry blossoms in Kyoto will bloom on March 24, 2026\n, according to the data of the 4th forecast, released on February 5, 2026, by the\nJapan Weather Association\n.\nKyoto cherry blossom dates 2026\nForecasted flowering date  24 March 2026\nForecasted full bloom date  1 April 2026\nIn the table below, you can find the cherry blossom season dates for the last few years.\nYear\nFlowering date\nFull bloom date\n2025\n27 March\n5 April\n2024\n29 March\n5 April\n2023\n17 March\n27 March\nHow long do cherry blossoms last in Kyoto?\nTypically, the\ncherry blossom season lasts around two weeks\n. After the initial blossoms open up, it generally takes about a week to reach full bloom. A week later (depending on the weather), the blossoms start falling from the trees.\nKyoto cherry blossom locations\nYou can\nfind here a map\nof all popular cherry blossom viewing spots.\nTips for Kyoto sakura season\nAccommodation\n Kyoto is incredibly popular during cherry blossom season for both domestic and international travel. Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months ahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom forecast, which happens in January.\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\n:\nThe Gate Hotel\nWhy\n: perfect central location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\nWhat I like\n: cosy lounge with bonfire and free drinks, great city views\nBest time to enjoy sakura\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season in Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\nconsidering arriving a few days before the officially projected full bloom date\n(and staying a few days in Kyoto) to ensure you catch the blossoms at their best. In case the full bloom date is earlier, youll arrive exactly for it, if it is later  youll arrive just a few days before the opening (which is better than arriving after the full bloom when everything is gone).\nAlthough I booked my trip after the official sakura forecast, the latter changed so much because of warm weather, that the full bloom was 10 days earlier! I was lucky that I planned to arrive 3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I arrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started losing their pink petals. Five days later, nearly all of the blossoms were gone.\nVisiting Kyoto for the first time? Then have a look at my detailed\nKyoto itinerary\n, which includes all must-see sights, the best temples to visit and my favourite places for soba noodles.\nBest Kyoto cherry blossom spots\nIf youre planning a trip to Kyoto during the sakura season, youll find cherry blossoms pretty much everywhere.\nThe city boasts almost 50 cherry blossom viewing spots\n, including temples, gardens, paths, and canals (\nsee all locations here\n). There are, however, some places that offer a truly breathtaking experience that you wont want to miss. Youll find all of the must-see sakura spots in my guide, including some hidden and less crowded places.\nCertain locations, such as\nMaruyama Park and Hirano Shrine host cherry blossom festivals\nwith special events and sakura-flavoured food. While, others like Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Nij Castle, have stunning night illuminations of cherry flowers.\nBest cherry blossom in Kyoto 2026\nMaruyama Park\nPhilosophers Walk\nNij Castle\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nDaigo-ji Temple\nKiyamachi Dori\nNinna-ji Temple\nHeian Shrine\nKyoto Botanical Garden\nTji Temple\nHirano Shrine\nMaruyama Park\nThe weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park\nFounded in 1886, Maruyama Park is the oldest park in Kyoto. It is located next to Yasaka Shrine and the historic Gion district, known for its traditional tea houses and geisha culture.\nWith its 680 cherry trees, the park is one of the most popular cherry blossom viewing spots in Kyoto\n.\nMaruyama Park is most\nfamous for its\nmassive weeping cherry tree\n(shidarezakura). Towering over 12m (39 feet) in height and over 80 years old, it has grown from a parent tree over 200 years old. The tree is illuminated in the evenings during the sakura season, creating a magical and romantic atmosphere.\nYoull also find food stalls and vendors selling souvenirs and food in the park. A great place to taste some local treats, such as matcha soft serve!\nSakura festival in Maruyama Park\nMatcha soft serve\nDespite the crowds, I found Maruyama Park incredibly romantic, especially at sunset. I highly recommend it for couples.\nAddress: Maruyamacho, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto 605-0071, Japan\nClosest station: Gion-Shijo Station station (Keihan line)\nIllumination: from sunset (around 6 PM) to 10 PM\nEntry: free\nPhilosophers Walk\nThe Philosophers Walk is a must-see sakura spot in Kyoto\nPhilosophers Walk (also known as Tetsugaku-no-michi in Japanese) is one of the most popular sakura spots in Kyoto.

But what exactly is kaiseki? It is a multi-course haute cuisine rooted in respect for seasonality, ingredients, presentation, and ritual.\nKaiseki is more than just food. Its an experience: the sequence of courses, the setting (tatami room, garden view, etc.), the aesthetic of plating, and the hospitality (omotenashi). All this combined makes for a truly elevated and unforgettable experience.\nWhile its true that some of the most prestigious kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto can cost upwards of 50,000 per person, the good news is this: you dont need to spend a fortune to experience it.\nIn this guide, well introduce you to 5 of the best budget-friendly kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto. These places strike the perfect balance between authenticity, atmosphere, and affordability.\nWhether youre a first-time visitor, a foodie on a budget, or simply curious about Japanese haute cuisine, you can savor Kyotos culinary heritage without emptying your wallet.\nWhat is Kaiseki?\nKaiseki () is Japans most refined form of\nmulti-course dining, often compared to haute cuisine in the West.\nOriginating in Kyoto, Kaiseki showcases the seasonality of ingredients\n, artistic presentation, and a balance of taste, texture, and appearance. More than just a meal, it is a cultural journey through Japanese hospitality (\nomotenashi\n) and aesthetics.\nOnce reserved for the nobility and tea ceremonies, kaiseki has evolved into an art form that celebrates seasonality, presentation, and the harmony of flavors. Each dish is prepared with meticulous attention to detail, highlighting the natural flavors of seasonal ingredients. Presentation, plating, and the sequence of courses are as important as taste, creating a dining experience that feels more like an art performance than just a meal.\nKey Features of Kaiseki\nSeasonal Ingredients (Shun):\nEvery dish reflects the current season, from springs bamboo shoots to autumns matsutake mushrooms.\nArtful Presentation:\nPlates are chosen to complement the food, creating a harmony of color, shape, and design.\nDelicate Balance:\nKaiseki emphasizes subtle flavors, ensuring no one element overwhelms the meal.\nCourse Flow:\nMeals usually progress from light dishes (like sashimi) to grilled, simmered, and steamed items, ending with rice and dessert.\nWhy is Kaiseki Special in Kyoto?\nKyoto is considered the birthplace of Kaiseki, influenced by Zen Buddhist tea ceremony traditions and the citys long history as Japans cultural capital.\nKyotos geography is unique, as it is surrounded by fertile valleys, mountains, and rivers. This provides chefs with an abundance of seasonal produce, freshwater fish, and mountain herbs, all of which shape their seasonal menus. The result is a dining experience that feels both timeless and deeply connected to nature, which are very important aspects of kaiseki.\nMany Michelin-starred restaurants and historic ryotei (traditional dining houses) in Kyoto serve kaiseki, making it the best place in Japan to experience this culinary art.\nTips for Choosing & Booking Kaiseki\nWhile on a Budget\nBefore we get into the kaiseki restaurants we recommend, lets discuss how to choose the best kaiseki restaurant for you, based on your budget, the season, and style.\nDepending on what kind of experience you want, here are things to think about:\nTime of Day\nLunch Kaiseki (or small courses) are often more affordable, less formal, and still excellent. Dinner is more elaborate.\nLocation & Atmosphere\nIf you want old Kyoto, geisha-district ambience, teahouse-y streets, gardens, pick places in Higashiyama, Gion, Arashiyama.\nMenu Seasonality\nTry to visit when ingredients are at peak (e.g. autumn mushrooms, winter fish etc.). Many top places only operate with certain courses during certain seasons.\nMake Reservations Early\nEspecially for the high end ones, youll often need to book weeks in advance. Some require contact by phone/email ahead.\nBook Early:\nBudget-friendly kaiseki spots are popular and often require reservations, especially on weekends.\nConsider Shojin Ryori:\nVegetarian temple cuisine is a unique, affordable alternative to traditional kaiseki.\nKeep an Open Mind:\nKaiseki is about subtle flavors, not bold seasonings. Approach it as a cultural experience as much as a meal.\nDress & Etiquette\nAs these establishments are for fine dining, please make sure to:\nRefrain from\nwearing casual clothes such as shorts or tank tops.\nRefrain from\nwearing sports or gym clothes, such as yoga pants or sweatpants.\nWear\nsocks. Many of these restaurants have you take your shoes off. Sandals are not allowed.\nRefrain from\nwearing strong perfume or cologne.\nIf you do not follow these rules, you\nmay be denied entry\nupon arrival.\nTop 5 Budget-Friendly Kaiseki Restaurants in Kyoto\nGion Maruyama ()\nWhy its great:\nGion Maruyama is a well-regarded kaiseki restaurant located in the heart of Kyotos historic geisha district. Known for its refined yet welcoming atmosphere, it offers a classic kaiseki experience without the intimidating price tag of ultra-high-end establishments like Kitcho. They are also a child-friendly restaurant, as they have a special kaiseki set just for children.\nCost:\nLunch courses start at around 18,000, offering excellent value for the quality. Dinner is more expensive (30,000+ depending on the season) but still reasonable compared to other top-tier dinner kaiseki courses.\nAtmosphere:\nTraditional tatami rooms and serene interiors make it ideal for an authentic Kyoto dining experience. This is the best experience if you want to balance budget, traditional atmosphere, and experience.\nLocation:\nConveniently located in Gion, making it easy to combine with sightseeing at Yasaka Shrine or Hanamikoji Street. You might even see a geisha on your way!\nReservations:\nReservations are highly recommended. Please\nvisit their website and reserve HERE\n.\nVisit\nGion Maruyama HERE\n!\nKinobu ()\nWhy its great:\nEstablished in the early 20th century, Kinobu is a family-run kaiseki restaurant that blends tradition with a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Unlike the ultra-formal establishments, Kinobu makes fine dining approachable while preserving authenticity. They also offer vegetarian kaiseki in the form of shojin ryori, or buddhist monk cuisine.\nCost:\nTheir traditional kaiseki dinner ranges from 17,60034,100 depending on the season. However, if youre aiming for a lower budget, they do beautiful Kyoto bento box lunches for 4,95010,800 depending on the season.\nAtmosphere:\nA calm, elegant setting with seasonal decor that reflects Kyotos rich cultural heritage.\nLocation:\nCentrally located near Shijo, making it convenient for travelers staying in downtown Kyoto.\nReservations\n: Reservations are recommended, especially for dinner. Please make a reservation via their phone number listed on\ntheir website HERE\nat the bottom of the site. (Have your hotel receptionist make the call if you would rather not talk on the phone, they would be happy to book for you.)\nVisit\nKinobu HERE\n.\nKikunoi Roan ( )\nWhy its great:\nThis is the younger sibling of the world-famous Kikunoi restaurant. While Kikunois main location in Higashiyama is a three-star Michelin restaurant and extremely pricey, Roan Kikunoi offers a more relaxed and affordable way to enjoy the same philosophy of seasonal cuisine while still being a two-star Michelin restaurant.\nBudget Tip:\nLunch courses start at\n14,500\n, a fraction of what youd pay at the flagship restaurant. Dinner courses start at 24,000.\nAtmosphere:\nModern, casual elegance, but still refined. We believe this is the best restaurant for those looking for a beginner-friendly",

In this article, the SAVOR JAPAN editorial team has carefully selected famous spots and nearby restaurants that are easy to incorporate into a night cherry blossom viewing itinerary. Reservations for the featured restaurants can be made through SAVOR JAPAN. Especially during the cherry blossom season, it is crowded, so securing a seat in advance allows you to fully enjoy a peaceful night in Kyoto.\n>> Best Spring Cherry Blossom Spots in Kyoto and Recommended Restaurants\n1. Kiyomizu-dera Temple\nAt the World Heritage Site Kiyomizu-dera, visitors can enjoy the magical collaboration of cherry blossoms at night and the temple buildings during the spring nighttime special viewing. The stage area and the slopes within the temple grounds bloom with Somei Yoshino and mountain cherry trees, which show a completely different majestic appearance when illuminated at night. The temple's varied elevations create a calming flow of people from the stage to the back, allowing for a serene cherry blossom viewing experience. There are also plenty of photo spots, including views looking up from beneath the stage and capturing cherry blossoms through the corridors. The nighttime viewing has limited periods and hours, and entry restrictions may apply, so it is advisable to check the official information in advance.\nKiyomizu-dera\nAddress:\n1-294 Kiyomizu, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture\nNearest station:\n- 10 minutes walk from 'Gojozaka' bus stop, accessed by bus from JR 'Kyoto Station' or Keihan Railway 'Gion-Shijo Station'\n- 10 minutes walk from 'Kiyomizu-michi' bus stop, accessed by bus from Hankyu Railway 'Kawaramachi Station'\nAdmission fee:\nAdults 500 yen, elementary and junior high school students 200 yen\nOpening hours:\n8:00 to 18:00 (reception closes at 21:00 during the spring nighttime special viewing period)\nLight-up time:\nApproximately 18:00 to 21:00 during the spring nighttime special viewing period\nTypical blooming period:\nEarly March to early April\nNumber of cherry trees:\nAbout 1,000\nRecommended Restaurants in the Vicinity | Miyagawacho Tensho\nA Japanese restaurant located in Miyagawa-cho.

Maruyama Park\nMaruyama Park in Kyoto is known as one of the premier cherry blossom viewing spots, boasting about 650 cherry trees that bloom spectacularly. The park features predominantly Somei Yoshino cherry trees, including the especially famous weeping cherry trees. At night, these trees are illuminated, creating a magical landscape. The central Gion weeping cherry tree exudes an overwhelming presence, and visitors can enjoy the changing expressions of the trees as they walk around and view them from different angles under the lights. The park is flat and easy to walk through, allowing for a pleasant stroll while admiring the cherry blossoms at night. Around 9 PM, the crowd usually thins, making it a good time for photography.

Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy. Quick Summary Heres how to break down four days in Kyoto Day One Arashiyama : Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park Day Two Higashiyama : Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda Day Three Fushimi Inari and Gion: Fushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine Day Four Temples and Tea : Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho This covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading. Article by Helen Foster. Disclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our Affiliate Disclosure. This plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights. Table of Contents [Open] [Close] Day One Arashiyama Day Two Higashiyama Day Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion Day Four: Temples and Tea Are You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season? Day One Arashiyama Start your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan. Start at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest As I explained in my post on how long to spend in Kyoto , one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first ideally before 8 am. The forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn dont miss it. Japlanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji If the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called Otagi Nenbutsu Ji. This is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto. Otagi-Nenbutsu Ji is a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people and every single one is different. Some are serious, but there",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",

Also known as sakura, the cherry blossoms are not only a beautiful sight but hold deep cultural significance in Japan as well. They symbolize the transient nature of life and the beauty of impermanence.\nEvery spring, usually\nfrom late March to early April, cherry trees in Kyoto burst into beautiful pink and white blooms\n, creating a stunning landscape of delicate flowers. Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry blossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. Some gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical atmosphere.\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the fact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. However, with careful planning, you can make it happen! Thats why Ive put together this\nKyoto cherry blossom guide\n. Here youll find all the information Ive collected before and during my trip to Japan, including the exact sakura festival dates, night illuminations and the best cherry blossom spots.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Guide 2026\nSpring is magical in Kyoto. Every year,\nbetween late March and early April, thousands of cherry trees\ndecorate the citys ancient temples and serene gardens in beautiful pink and white colours. Its likely the most scenic time of year, but its fleeting,\nlasting just two weeks\n. Be sure to plan your visit carefully to catch it at its best.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Forecast 2026\nEvery year in January, the Japan Weather Association releases the cherry blossom forecast. This forecast provides information about when the flowers will begin to bloom and when they will reach full bloom across Japan.\nHowever, keep in mind that these dates are not final, because they depend a lot on the weather. Typically, if the weather is mild during the weeks before the sakura season, the trees tend to bloom earlier. Conversely, colder weather delays the blossoms from opening. The dates may shift either earlier or later (even up to 10 days), depending on weather conditions.\nIn recent years, the first blooms in Kyoto have been observed between March 17 and March 26. The full bloom typically reaches its peak between March 26 and April 4.\nThis year,\nthe first cherry blossoms in Kyoto will bloom on March 24, 2026\n, according to the data of the 4th forecast, released on February 5, 2026, by the\nJapan Weather Association\n.\nKyoto cherry blossom dates 2026\nForecasted flowering date  24 March 2026\nForecasted full bloom date  1 April 2026\nIn the table below, you can find the cherry blossom season dates for the last few years.\nYear\nFlowering date\nFull bloom date\n2025\n27 March\n5 April\n2024\n29 March\n5 April\n2023\n17 March\n27 March\nHow long do cherry blossoms last in Kyoto?\nTypically, the\ncherry blossom season lasts around two weeks\n. After the initial blossoms open up, it generally takes about a week to reach full bloom. A week later (depending on the weather), the blossoms start falling from the trees.\nKyoto cherry blossom locations\nYou can\nfind here a map\nof all popular cherry blossom viewing spots.\nTips for Kyoto sakura season\nAccommodation\n Kyoto is incredibly popular during cherry blossom season for both domestic and international travel. Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months ahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom forecast, which happens in January.\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\n:\nThe Gate Hotel\nWhy\n: perfect central location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\nWhat I like\n: cosy lounge with bonfire and free drinks, great city views\nBest time to enjoy sakura\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season in Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\nconsidering arriving a few days before the officially projected full bloom date\n(and staying a few days in Kyoto) to ensure you catch the blossoms at their best. In case the full bloom date is earlier, youll arrive exactly for it, if it is later  youll arrive just a few days before the opening (which is better than arriving after the full bloom when everything is gone).\nAlthough I booked my trip after the official sakura forecast, the latter changed so much because of warm weather, that the full bloom was 10 days earlier! I was lucky that I planned to arrive 3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I arrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started losing their pink petals. Five days later, nearly all of the blossoms were gone.\nVisiting Kyoto for the first time? Then have a look at my detailed\nKyoto itinerary\n, which includes all must-see sights, the best temples to visit and my favourite places for soba noodles.\nBest Kyoto cherry blossom spots\nIf youre planning a trip to Kyoto during the sakura season, youll find cherry blossoms pretty much everywhere.\nThe city boasts almost 50 cherry blossom viewing spots\n, including temples, gardens, paths, and canals (\nsee all locations here\n). There are, however, some places that offer a truly breathtaking experience that you wont want to miss. Youll find all of the must-see sakura spots in my guide, including some hidden and less crowded places.\nCertain locations, such as\nMaruyama Park and Hirano Shrine host cherry blossom festivals\nwith special events and sakura-flavoured food. While, others like Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Nij Castle, have stunning night illuminations of cherry flowers.\nBest cherry blossom in Kyoto 2026\nMaruyama Park\nPhilosophers Walk\nNij Castle\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nDaigo-ji Temple\nKiyamachi Dori\nNinna-ji Temple\nHeian Shrine\nKyoto Botanical Garden\nTji Temple\nHirano Shrine\nMaruyama Park\nThe weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park\nFounded in 1886, Maruyama Park is the oldest park in Kyoto. It is located next to Yasaka Shrine and the historic Gion district, known for its traditional tea houses and geisha culture.\nWith its 680 cherry trees, the park is one of the most popular cherry blossom viewing spots in Kyoto\n.\nMaruyama Park is most\nfamous for its\nmassive weeping cherry tree\n(shidarezakura). Towering over 12m (39 feet) in height and over 80 years old, it has grown from a parent tree over 200 years old. The tree is illuminated in the evenings during the sakura season, creating a magical and romantic atmosphere.\nYoull also find food stalls and vendors selling souvenirs and food in the park. A great place to taste some local treats, such as matcha soft serve!\nSakura festival in Maruyama Park\nMatcha soft serve\nDespite the crowds, I found Maruyama Park incredibly romantic, especially at sunset. I highly recommend it for couples.\nAddress: Maruyamacho, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto 605-0071, Japan\nClosest station: Gion-Shijo Station station (Keihan line)\nIllumination: from sunset (around 6 PM) to 10 PM\nEntry: free\nPhilosophers Walk\nThe Philosophers Walk is a must-see sakura spot in Kyoto\nPhilosophers Walk (also known as Tetsugaku-no-michi in Japanese) is one of the most popular sakura spots in Kyoto.

Also known as sakura, the cherry blossoms are not only a beautiful sight but hold deep cultural significance in Japan as well. They symbolize the transient nature of life and the beauty of impermanence.\nEvery spring, usually\nfrom late March to early April, cherry trees in Kyoto burst into beautiful pink and white blooms\n, creating a stunning landscape of delicate flowers. Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry blossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. Some gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical atmosphere.\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the fact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. However, with careful planning, you can make it happen! Thats why Ive put together this\nKyoto cherry blossom guide\n. Here youll find all the information Ive collected before and during my trip to Japan, including the exact sakura festival dates, night illuminations and the best cherry blossom spots.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Guide 2026\nSpring is magical in Kyoto. Every year,\nbetween late March and early April, thousands of cherry trees\ndecorate the citys ancient temples and serene gardens in beautiful pink and white colours. Its likely the most scenic time of year, but its fleeting,\nlasting just two weeks\n. Be sure to plan your visit carefully to catch it at its best.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Forecast 2026\nEvery year in January, the Japan Weather Association releases the cherry blossom forecast. This forecast provides information about when the flowers will begin to bloom and when they will reach full bloom across Japan.\nHowever, keep in mind that these dates are not final, because they depend a lot on the weather. Typically, if the weather is mild during the weeks before the sakura season, the trees tend to bloom earlier. Conversely, colder weather delays the blossoms from opening. The dates may shift either earlier or later (even up to 10 days), depending on weather conditions.\nIn recent years, the first blooms in Kyoto have been observed between March 17 and March 26. The full bloom typically reaches its peak between March 26 and April 4.\nThis year,\nthe first cherry blossoms in Kyoto will bloom on March 24, 2026\n, according to the data of the 4th forecast, released on February 5, 2026, by the\nJapan Weather Association\n.\nKyoto cherry blossom dates 2026\nForecasted flowering date  24 March 2026\nForecasted full bloom date  1 April 2026\nIn the table below, you can find the cherry blossom season dates for the last few years.\nYear\nFlowering date\nFull bloom date\n2025\n27 March\n5 April\n2024\n29 March\n5 April\n2023\n17 March\n27 March\nHow long do cherry blossoms last in Kyoto?\nTypically, the\ncherry blossom season lasts around two weeks\n. After the initial blossoms open up, it generally takes about a week to reach full bloom. A week later (depending on the weather), the blossoms start falling from the trees.\nKyoto cherry blossom locations\nYou can\nfind here a map\nof all popular cherry blossom viewing spots.\nTips for Kyoto sakura season\nAccommodation\n Kyoto is incredibly popular during cherry blossom season for both domestic and international travel. Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months ahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom forecast, which happens in January.\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\n:\nThe Gate Hotel\nWhy\n: perfect central location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\nWhat I like\n: cosy lounge with bonfire and free drinks, great city views\nBest time to enjoy sakura\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season in Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\nconsidering arriving a few days before the officially projected full bloom date\n(and staying a few days in Kyoto) to ensure you catch the blossoms at their best. In case the full bloom date is earlier, youll arrive exactly for it, if it is later  youll arrive just a few days before the opening (which is better than arriving after the full bloom when everything is gone).\nAlthough I booked my trip after the official sakura forecast, the latter changed so much because of warm weather, that the full bloom was 10 days earlier! I was lucky that I planned to arrive 3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I arrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started losing their pink petals. Five days later, nearly all of the blossoms were gone.\nVisiting Kyoto for the first time? Then have a look at my detailed\nKyoto itinerary\n, which includes all must-see sights, the best temples to visit and my favourite places for soba noodles.\nBest Kyoto cherry blossom spots\nIf youre planning a trip to Kyoto during the sakura season, youll find cherry blossoms pretty much everywhere.\nThe city boasts almost 50 cherry blossom viewing spots\n, including temples, gardens, paths, and canals (\nsee all locations here\n). There are, however, some places that offer a truly breathtaking experience that you wont want to miss. Youll find all of the must-see sakura spots in my guide, including some hidden and less crowded places.\nCertain locations, such as\nMaruyama Park and Hirano Shrine host cherry blossom festivals\nwith special events and sakura-flavoured food. While, others like Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Nij Castle, have stunning night illuminations of cherry flowers.\nBest cherry blossom in Kyoto 2026\nMaruyama Park\nPhilosophers Walk\nNij Castle\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nDaigo-ji Temple\nKiyamachi Dori\nNinna-ji Temple\nHeian Shrine\nKyoto Botanical Garden\nTji Temple\nHirano Shrine\nMaruyama Park\nThe weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park\nFounded in 1886, Maruyama Park is the oldest park in Kyoto. It is located next to Yasaka Shrine and the historic Gion district, known for its traditional tea houses and geisha culture.\nWith its 680 cherry trees, the park is one of the most popular cherry blossom viewing spots in Kyoto\n.\nMaruyama Park is most\nfamous for its\nmassive weeping cherry tree\n(shidarezakura). Towering over 12m (39 feet) in height and over 80 years old, it has grown from a parent tree over 200 years old. The tree is illuminated in the evenings during the sakura season, creating a magical and romantic atmosphere.\nYoull also find food stalls and vendors selling souvenirs and food in the park. A great place to taste some local treats, such as matcha soft serve!\nSakura festival in Maruyama Park\nMatcha soft serve\nDespite the crowds, I found Maruyama Park incredibly romantic, especially at sunset. I highly recommend it for couples.\nAddress: Maruyamacho, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto 605-0071, Japan\nClosest station: Gion-Shijo Station station (Keihan line)\nIllumination: from sunset (around 6 PM) to 10 PM\nEntry: free\nPhilosophers Walk\nThe Philosophers Walk is a must-see sakura spot in Kyoto\nPhilosophers Walk (also known as Tetsugaku-no-michi in Japanese) is one of the most popular sakura spots in Kyoto. This\npicturesque canal-side path is lined with more than 400 cherry trees\n, creating a stunning tunnel of pink and white blossoms in the spring. It is named after the fam",

Also known as sakura, the cherry blossoms are not only a beautiful sight but hold deep cultural significance in Japan as well. They symbolize the transient nature of life and the beauty of impermanence.\nEvery spring, usually\nfrom late March to early April, cherry trees in Kyoto burst into beautiful pink and white blooms\n, creating a stunning landscape of delicate flowers. Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry blossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. Some gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical atmosphere.\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the fact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. However, with careful planning, you can make it happen! Thats why Ive put together this\nKyoto cherry blossom guide\n. Here youll find all the information Ive collected before and during my trip to Japan, including the exact sakura festival dates, night illuminations and the best cherry blossom spots.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Guide 2026\nSpring is magical in Kyoto. Every year,\nbetween late March and early April, thousands of cherry trees\ndecorate the citys ancient temples and serene gardens in beautiful pink and white colours. Its likely the most scenic time of year, but its fleeting,\nlasting just two weeks\n. Be sure to plan your visit carefully to catch it at its best.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Forecast 2026\nEvery year in January, the Japan Weather Association releases the cherry blossom forecast. This forecast provides information about when the flowers will begin to bloom and when they will reach full bloom across Japan.\nHowever, keep in mind that these dates are not final, because they depend a lot on the weather. Typically, if the weather is mild during the weeks before the sakura season, the trees tend to bloom earlier. Conversely, colder weather delays the blossoms from opening. The dates may shift either earlier or later (even up to 10 days), depending on weather conditions.\nIn recent years, the first blooms in Kyoto have been observed between March 17 and March 26. The full bloom typically reaches its peak between March 26 and April 4.\nThis year,\nthe first cherry blossoms in Kyoto will bloom on March 24, 2026\n, according to the data of the 4th forecast, released on February 5, 2026, by the\nJapan Weather Association\n.\nKyoto cherry blossom dates 2026\nForecasted flowering date  24 March 2026\nForecasted full bloom date  1 April 2026\nIn the table below, you can find the cherry blossom season dates for the last few years.\nYear\nFlowering date\nFull bloom date\n2025\n27 March\n5 April\n2024\n29 March\n5 April\n2023\n17 March\n27 March\nHow long do cherry blossoms last in Kyoto?\nTypically, the\ncherry blossom season lasts around two weeks\n. After the initial blossoms open up, it generally takes about a week to reach full bloom. A week later (depending on the weather), the blossoms start falling from the trees.\nKyoto cherry blossom locations\nYou can\nfind here a map\nof all popular cherry blossom viewing spots.\nTips for Kyoto sakura season\nAccommodation\n Kyoto is incredibly popular during cherry blossom season for both domestic and international travel. Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months ahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom forecast, which happens in January.\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\n:\nThe Gate Hotel\nWhy\n: perfect central location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\nWhat I like\n: cosy lounge with bonfire and free drinks, great city views\nBest time to enjoy sakura\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season in Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\nconsidering arriving a few days before the officially projected full bloom date\n(and staying a few days in Kyoto) to ensure you catch the blossoms at their best. In case the full bloom date is earlier, youll arrive exactly for it, if it is later  youll arrive just a few days before the opening (which is better than arriving after the full bloom when everything is gone).\nAlthough I booked my trip after the official sakura forecast, the latter changed so much because of warm weather, that the full bloom was 10 days earlier! I was lucky that I planned to arrive 3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I arrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started losing their pink petals. Five days later, nearly all of the blossoms were gone.\nVisiting Kyoto for the first time? Then have a look at my detailed\nKyoto itinerary\n, which includes all must-see sights, the best temples to visit and my favourite places for soba noodles.\nBest Kyoto cherry blossom spots\nIf youre planning a trip to Kyoto during the sakura season, youll find cherry blossoms pretty much everywhere.\nThe city boasts almost 50 cherry blossom viewing spots\n, including temples, gardens, paths, and canals (\nsee all locations here\n). There are, however, some places that offer a truly breathtaking experience that you wont want to miss. Youll find all of the must-see sakura spots in my guide, including some hidden and less crowded places.\nCertain locations, such as\nMaruyama Park and Hirano Shrine host cherry blossom festivals\nwith special events and sakura-flavoured food. While, others like Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Nij Castle, have stunning night illuminations of cherry flowers.\nBest cherry blossom in Kyoto 2026\nMaruyama Park\nPhilosophers Walk\nNij Castle\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nDaigo-ji Temple\nKiyamachi Dori\nNinna-ji Temple\nHeian Shrine\nKyoto Botanical Garden\nTji Temple\nHirano Shrine\nMaruyama Park\nThe weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park\nFounded in 1886, Maruyama Park is the oldest park in Kyoto. It is located next to Yasaka Shrine and the historic Gion district, known for its traditional tea houses and geisha culture.\nWith its 680 cherry trees, the park is one of the most popular cherry blossom viewing spots in Kyoto\n.\nMaruyama Park is most\nfamous for its\nmassive weeping cherry tree\n(shidarezakura). Towering over 12m (39 feet) in height and over 80 years old, it has grown from a parent tree over 200 years old. The tree is illuminated in the evenings during the sakura season, creating a magical and romantic atmosphere.\nYoull also find food stalls and vendors selling souvenirs and food in the park. A great place to taste some local treats, such as matcha soft serve!\nSakura festival in Maruyama Park\nMatcha soft serve\nDespite the crowds, I found Maruyama Park incredibly romantic, especially at sunset. I highly recommend it for couples.\nAddress: Maruyamacho, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto 605-0071, Japan\nClosest station: Gion-Shijo Station station (Keihan line)\nIllumination: from sunset (around 6 PM) to 10 PM\nEntry: free\nPhilosophers Walk\nThe Philosophers Walk is a must-see sakura spot in Kyoto\nPhilosophers Walk (also known as Tetsugaku-no-michi in Japanese) is one of the most popular sakura spots in Kyoto.

Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy. Quick Summary Heres how to break down four days in Kyoto Day One Arashiyama : Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park Day Two Higashiyama : Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda Day Three Fushimi Inari and Gion: Fushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine Day Four Temples and Tea : Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho This covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading. Article by Helen Foster. Disclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our Affiliate Disclosure. This plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights. Table of Contents [Open] [Close] Day One Arashiyama Day Two Higashiyama Day Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion Day Four: Temples and Tea Are You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season? Day One Arashiyama Start your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan. Start at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest As I explained in my post on how long to spend in Kyoto , one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first ideally before 8 am. The forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn dont miss it. Japlanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji If the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called Otagi Nenbutsu Ji. This is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto. Otagi-Nenbutsu Ji is a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people and every single one is different. Some are serious, but there",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",

Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mblossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mSome gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32matmosphere.\\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mfact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mHowever, with careful planning, you can make it happen!

Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mforecast, which happens in January.\\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\\n:\\nThe Gate Hotel\\nWhy\\n: perfect\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mcentral location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\\nWhat I like\\n: cosy lounge with bonfire \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mand free drinks, great city views\\nBest time to enjoy sakura\\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32min Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\\nconsidering arriving a few days before \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mthe officially projected full bloom date\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32mand staying a few days in Kyoto\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m to ensure you catch the \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mblossoms at their best.

I was lucky that I planned to arrive\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32marrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mlosing their pink petals.

Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mblossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mSome gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32matmosphere.\\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mfact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mHowever, with careful planning, you can make it happen!

This forecast provides \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32minformation about when the flowers will begin to bloom and when they will reach full bloom across \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mJapan.\\nHowever, keep in mind that these dates are not final, because they depend a lot on the weather. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mTypically, if the weather is mild during the weeks before the sakura season, the trees tend to bloom \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mearlier. Conversely, colder weather delays the blossoms from opening.

The full bloom typically reaches its peak between March \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m26 and April 4.\\nThis year,\\nthe first cherry blossoms in Kyoto will bloom on March 24, 2026\\n, according \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mto the data of the 4th forecast, released on February 5, 2026, by the\\nJapan Weather Association\\n.\\nKyoto \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mcherry blossom dates 2026\\nForecasted flowering date  24 March 2026\\nForecasted full bloom date  1 April \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m2026\\nIn the table below, you can find the cherry blossom season dates for the last few \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32myears.\\nYear\\nFlowering date\\nFull bloom date\\n2025\\n27 March\\n5 April\\n2024\\n29 March\\n5 April\\n2023\\n17 \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mMarch\\n27 March\\nHow long do cherry blossoms last in Kyoto?\\nTypically, the\\ncherry blossom season lasts \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32maround two weeks\\n.

Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mforecast, which happens in January.\\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\\n:\\nThe Gate Hotel\\nWhy\\n: perfect\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mcentral location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\\nWhat I like\\n: cosy lounge with bonfire \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mand free drinks, great city views\\nBest time to enjoy sakura\\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32min Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\\nconsidering arriving a few days before \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mthe officially projected full bloom date\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32mand staying a few days in Kyoto\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m to ensure you catch the \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mblossoms at their best. In case the full bloom date is earlier, youll arrive exactly for it, if it is later\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32myoull arrive just a few days before the opening \u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32mwhich is better than arriving after the full bloom when \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32meverything is gone\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m.\\nAlthough I booked my trip after the official sakura forecast, the latter changed so \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mmuch because of warm weather, that the full bloom was 10 days earlier! I was lucky that I planned to arrive\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32marrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mlosing their pink petals.

Also known as sakura, \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mthe cherry blossoms are not only a beautiful sight but hold deep cultural significance in Japan as well. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mThey symbolize the transient nature of life and the beauty of impermanence.\\nEvery spring, usually\\nfrom \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mlate March to early April, cherry trees in Kyoto burst into beautiful pink and white blooms\\n, creating a \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mstunning landscape of delicate flowers. Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mblossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mSome gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32matmosphere.\\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mfact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mHowever, with careful planning, you can make it happen!

Conversely, colder weather delays the blossoms from opening.

The full bloom typically reaches its peak between March \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m26 and April 4.\\nThis year,\\nthe first cherry blossoms in Kyoto will bloom on March 24, 2026\\n, according \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mto the data of the 4th forecast, released on February 5, 2026, by the\\nJapan Weather Association\\n.\\nKyoto \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mcherry blossom dates 2026\\nForecasted flowering date  24 March 2026\\nForecasted full bloom date  1 April \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m2026\\nIn the table below, you can find the cherry blossom season dates for the last few \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32myears.\\nYear\\nFlowering date\\nFull bloom date\\n2025\\n27 March\\n5 April\\n2024\\n29 March\\n5 April\\n2023\\n17 \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mMarch\\n27 March\\nHow long do cherry blossoms last in Kyoto?\\nTypically, the\\ncherry blossom season lasts \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32maround two weeks\\n.

Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mforecast, which happens in January.\\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\\n:\\nThe Gate Hotel\\nWhy\\n: perfect\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mcentral location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\\nWhat I like\\n: cosy lounge with bonfire \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mand free drinks, great city views\\nBest time to enjoy sakura\\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32min Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\\nconsidering arriving a few days before \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mthe officially projected full bloom date\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32mand staying a few days in Kyoto\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m to ensure you catch the \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mblossoms at their best. In case the full bloom date is earlier, youll arrive exactly for it, if it is later\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32myoull arrive just a few days before the opening \u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32mwhich is better than arriving after the full bloom when \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32meverything is gone\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m.\\nAlthough I booked my trip after the official sakura forecast, the latter changed so \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mmuch because of warm weather, that the full bloom was 10 days earlier! I was lucky that I planned to arrive\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32marrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mlosing their pink petals.

Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mblossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mSome gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32matmosphere.\\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky.

Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mforecast, which happens in January.\\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\\n:\\nThe Gate Hotel\\nWhy\\n: perfect\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mcentral location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\\nWhat I like\\n: cosy lounge with bonfire \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mand free drinks, great city views\\nBest time to enjoy sakura\\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32min Japan has started earlier than expected.

I was lucky that I planned to arrive\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32marrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started \u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32mlosing their pink petals.

Here are some of the best places to stay for easy access to the cherry blossoms. Haradani-en Garden in cherry blossom season Chris Rowthorn First, as noted above, if you plan to be in Kyoto during cherry blossom season, book your accommodations WELL IN ADVANCE. Ideally, book several months in advance. If you wait until the last minute, you might find all the good places fully booked. Check Current Kyoto Hotel Availability You can check current Kyoto hotel availability for mid-March to mid-April, when the cherry blossoms bloom, on Booking.com and Agoda.com . Please have a read of When Is Cherry Blossom Season in Kyoto? to help you decide on the exact time to go. Check Hotel Availability Destination Check-in date Check-out date Recommended Places To Stay In Kyoto During Cherry Blossom Season One thing to keep in mind is that some of the main roads in the Southern Higashiyama and Northern Higashiyama districts become gridlocked during this season. (These are two of the most popular areas visited by tourists, both domestic and foreign). Thus, you might consider staying someplace near Kyoto Station or in Downtown Kyoto or Central Kyoto . Here are the places that I consider the best choices for cherry blossom season in Kyoto. These are the places Ive stayed in and recommend to my clients and friends. Corner King room at the Hotel Okura Kyoto Chris Rowthorn Kyoto Hotel Okura The Kyoto Hotel Okura has the most convenient location of any hotel in Kyoto (its right downtown and directly above a subway line). Its a luxury hotel with reasonable prices. Check out the pic above that I took of my corner room at the Okura recently. My room at the Genji Kyoto Chris Rowthorn Genji Kyoto A short walk from downtown, this little hotel is a real gem. Some rooms have private balconies overlooking the Kamo River. You can enjoy the cherry blossoms from the rooftop garden. I was lucky enough to stay at the Genji recently and I loved it (see the pic of my room above). Granvia Hotel Kyoto superior twin room Granvia Hotel Kyoto The Kyoto Hotel Granvia is not only the best hotel in the Kyoto Station area, its also the most convenient, since it located directly above the station itself. I stayed in a superior room here a few years back and loved it; it was quiet, spacious, clean and felt like a sanctuary above the city. Old Kyoto Machiya Old Modern Garden Suite Old Kyoto Machiya Old Kyoto is a group of perfectly restored and updated traditional Kyoto townhouses (machiya). They bring together the best features of ryokan, hotels and vacation rentals. Ive stayed in most of them and they are my favorite places to stay in the city. Visit our Old Kyoto Machiya page for all the details and pictures. Nohga Hotel Kiyomizu Kyoto rooftop garden Nohga Hotel Kiyomizu Kyoto With a great restaurant and a rooftop bar that offers amazing views over the city, this well-designed hotel is within walking distance of the major sights of southern Higashiyama (but on Gojo-dori, so traffic isnt that bad). Shimbashi (Shirakawa) in cherry blossom season Travelpixs / Shutterstock.com Alternatives To Staying In Kyoto If all accommodation is sold out in Kyoto during cherry blossom season, dont despair: Osaka has a lot of hotels and its less than 15 minutes from Osaka to Kyoto by shinkansen (bullet train) and about 45 minutes by regular express train. :: Check availability and pricing for hotels in Osaka on Booking.com or Agoda.com . Likewise, even Nagoya is within striking distanc",

Kyoto's cherry blossoms offer the most beautiful scenery of delicate sakura (cherry tree flowers) set against ancient buildings, within historical temples, and amid charming gardens. The cherry blossom season in Kyoto is similar to that of Tokyo and Osaka. Here is a guide to the Kyoto cherry blossom season: when and where to see the cherry blossoms and travel suggestions. Hirano Shrine cherry blossom When to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto 2026? Best time to see : April 2/3-April 10 Cherry blossom season : Late March to mid-April The cherry blossoms and red shrine create an ultimate sense of beauty The best time to view cherry blossoms in Kyoto is from April 2/3 to April 10, when the majority of cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Kyoto's cherry blossom season lasts from late March to mid-April, with most trees blooming in early April. Early blooms can be seen in late March at Maruyama Park and Kodaiji Temple, while late blooms extend to mid-April at Heian Shrine and Ninna-ji Temple. If you travel in spring with us, our guide will help you find the best cherry blossoms around. In 2025, the full blooms occurred around April 5 , and the best viewing periods were from April 3 to April 10. When we visited on April 7th, we saw the spectacular full blooms. In 2026, the cherry blossom season in Kyoto is likely to fall within this period. The 10 Best Places to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto Kyoto's cherry blossom season offers a unique charm with its historic atmosphere. To truly feel it, take a slow stroll along the Philosopher's Path or explore the hillside views at Kiyomizu-dera Temple. For something unique, hop on a traditional boat along the Fushimi Jikkokubune Canal and glide beneath blooming sakura trees, surrounded by Kyoto's old-town charm. 1. Philosopher's Path Philosopher's Path cherry blossom, April 7, 2025 Best viewing time : early April Philosopher's Path is a tranquil stone path along a winding, narrow canal. Both sides of the canal are densely lined with tall cherry trees. It is named after a famous philosopher, Nishida Kitaro, who used to meditate while walking there. The trail is a gorgeous place to enjoy a leisurely walk with your family or loved one. To make the most of your visit, start your walk along the path and continue to Nanzen-ji Temple, with a detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. This popular Kyoto trail offers more than just cherry blossoms; you'll also encounter historic buildings and two hidden temples. The whole tour takes about 2 hours. Enjoy a walk along the Philosopher's Path, and take a short detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. Visit before 10 a.m. for a peaceful stroll away from the crowds. The period from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. is the busiest, so it's best to avoid this time if you prefer a quieter experience. The path is illuminated in the evening. Along the path, there are small houses serving as restaurants and coffee shops. The path is smooth and accessible, with no steps or inclines, making it suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, and prams. 2. Kiyomizu-dera Temple Cherry blossoms at Kiyomizu-dera Temple The white and pink cherry blossoms against the red buildings of Kiyomizu-dera create an intimate beauty.

Here are some of the best places to stay for easy access to the cherry blossoms. Haradani-en Garden in cherry blossom season Chris Rowthorn First, as noted above, if you plan to be in Kyoto during cherry blossom season, book your accommodations WELL IN ADVANCE. Ideally, book several months in advance. If you wait until the last minute, you might find all the good places fully booked. Check Current Kyoto Hotel Availability You can check current Kyoto hotel availability for mid-March to mid-April, when the cherry blossoms bloom, on Booking.com and Agoda.com . Please have a read of When Is Cherry Blossom Season in Kyoto? to help you decide on the exact time to go. Check Hotel Availability Destination Check-in date Check-out date Recommended Places To Stay In Kyoto During Cherry Blossom Season One thing to keep in mind is that some of the main roads in the Southern Higashiyama and Northern Higashiyama districts become gridlocked during this season. (These are two of the most popular areas visited by tourists, both domestic and foreign). Thus, you might consider staying someplace near Kyoto Station or in Downtown Kyoto or Central Kyoto . Here are the places that I consider the best choices for cherry blossom season in Kyoto. These are the places Ive stayed in and recommend to my clients and friends. Corner King room at the Hotel Okura Kyoto Chris Rowthorn Kyoto Hotel Okura The Kyoto Hotel Okura has the most convenient location of any hotel in Kyoto (its right downtown and directly above a subway line). Its a luxury hotel with reasonable prices. Check out the pic above that I took of my corner room at the Okura recently. My room at the Genji Kyoto Chris Rowthorn Genji Kyoto A short walk from downtown, this little hotel is a real gem. Some rooms have private balconies overlooking the Kamo River. You can enjoy the cherry blossoms from the rooftop garden. I was lucky enough to stay at the Genji recently and I loved it (see the pic of my room above). Granvia Hotel Kyoto superior twin room Granvia Hotel Kyoto The Kyoto Hotel Granvia is not only the best hotel in the Kyoto Station area, its also the most convenient, since it located directly above the station itself. I stayed in a superior room here a few years back and loved it; it was quiet, spacious, clean and felt like a sanctuary above the city. Old Kyoto Machiya Old Modern Garden Suite Old Kyoto Machiya Old Kyoto is a group of perfectly restored and updated traditional Kyoto townhouses (machiya). They bring together the best features of ryokan, hotels and vacation rentals. Ive stayed in most of them and they are my favorite places to stay in the city. Visit our Old Kyoto Machiya page for all the details and pictures. Nohga Hotel Kiyomizu Kyoto rooftop garden Nohga Hotel Kiyomizu Kyoto With a great restaurant and a rooftop bar that offers amazing views over the city, this well-designed hotel is within walking distance of the major sights of southern Higashiyama (but on Gojo-dori, so traffic isnt that bad). Shimbashi (Shirakawa) in cherry blossom season Travelpixs / Shutterstock.com Alternatives To Staying In Kyoto If all accommodation is sold out in Kyoto during cherry blossom season, dont despair: Osaka has a lot of hotels and its less than 15 minutes from Osaka to Kyoto by shinkansen (bullet train) and about 45 minutes by regular express train. :: Check availability and pricing for hotels in Osaka on Booking.com or Agoda.com . Likewise, even Nagoya is within striking distanc",

Kyoto's cherry blossoms offer the most beautiful scenery of delicate sakura (cherry tree flowers) set against ancient buildings, within historical temples, and amid charming gardens. The cherry blossom season in Kyoto is similar to that of Tokyo and Osaka. Here is a guide to the Kyoto cherry blossom season: when and where to see the cherry blossoms and travel suggestions. Hirano Shrine cherry blossom When to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto 2026? Best time to see : April 2/3-April 10 Cherry blossom season : Late March to mid-April The cherry blossoms and red shrine create an ultimate sense of beauty The best time to view cherry blossoms in Kyoto is from April 2/3 to April 10, when the majority of cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Kyoto's cherry blossom season lasts from late March to mid-April, with most trees blooming in early April. Early blooms can be seen in late March at Maruyama Park and Kodaiji Temple, while late blooms extend to mid-April at Heian Shrine and Ninna-ji Temple. If you travel in spring with us, our guide will help you find the best cherry blossoms around. In 2025, the full blooms occurred around April 5 , and the best viewing periods were from April 3 to April 10. When we visited on April 7th, we saw the spectacular full blooms. In 2026, the cherry blossom season in Kyoto is likely to fall within this period. The 10 Best Places to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto Kyoto's cherry blossom season offers a unique charm with its historic atmosphere. To truly feel it, take a slow stroll along the Philosopher's Path or explore the hillside views at Kiyomizu-dera Temple. For something unique, hop on a traditional boat along the Fushimi Jikkokubune Canal and glide beneath blooming sakura trees, surrounded by Kyoto's old-town charm. 1. Philosopher's Path Philosopher's Path cherry blossom, April 7, 2025 Best viewing time : early April Philosopher's Path is a tranquil stone path along a winding, narrow canal. Both sides of the canal are densely lined with tall cherry trees. It is named after a famous philosopher, Nishida Kitaro, who used to meditate while walking there. The trail is a gorgeous place to enjoy a leisurely walk with your family or loved one. To make the most of your visit, start your walk along the path and continue to Nanzen-ji Temple, with a detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. This popular Kyoto trail offers more than just cherry blossoms; you'll also encounter historic buildings and two hidden temples. The whole tour takes about 2 hours. Enjoy a walk along the Philosopher's Path, and take a short detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. Visit before 10 a.m. for a peaceful stroll away from the crowds. The period from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. is the busiest, so it's best to avoid this time if you prefer a quieter experience. The path is illuminated in the evening. Along the path, there are small houses serving as restaurants and coffee shops. The path is smooth and accessible, with no steps or inclines, making it suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, and prams. 2. Kiyomizu-dera Temple Cherry blossoms at Kiyomizu-dera Temple The white and pink cherry blossoms against the red buildings of Kiyomizu-dera create an intimate beauty.

But what exactly is kaiseki? It is a multi-course haute cuisine rooted in respect for seasonality, ingredients, presentation, and ritual.\nKaiseki is more than just food. Its an experience: the sequence of courses, the setting (tatami room, garden view, etc.), the aesthetic of plating, and the hospitality (omotenashi). All this combined makes for a truly elevated and unforgettable experience.\nWhile its true that some of the most prestigious kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto can cost upwards of 50,000 per person, the good news is this: you dont need to spend a fortune to experience it.\nIn this guide, well introduce you to 5 of the best budget-friendly kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto. These places strike the perfect balance between authenticity, atmosphere, and affordability.\nWhether youre a first-time visitor, a foodie on a budget, or simply curious about Japanese haute cuisine, you can savor Kyotos culinary heritage without emptying your wallet.\nWhat is Kaiseki?\nKaiseki () is Japans most refined form of\nmulti-course dining, often compared to haute cuisine in the West.\nOriginating in Kyoto, Kaiseki showcases the seasonality of ingredients\n, artistic presentation, and a balance of taste, texture, and appearance. More than just a meal, it is a cultural journey through Japanese hospitality (\nomotenashi\n) and aesthetics.\nOnce reserved for the nobility and tea ceremonies, kaiseki has evolved into an art form that celebrates seasonality, presentation, and the harmony of flavors. Each dish is prepared with meticulous attention to detail, highlighting the natural flavors of seasonal ingredients. Presentation, plating, and the sequence of courses are as important as taste, creating a dining experience that feels more like an art performance than just a meal.\nKey Features of Kaiseki\nSeasonal Ingredients (Shun):\nEvery dish reflects the current season, from springs bamboo shoots to autumns matsutake mushrooms.\nArtful Presentation:\nPlates are chosen to complement the food, creating a harmony of color, shape, and design.\nDelicate Balance:\nKaiseki emphasizes subtle flavors, ensuring no one element overwhelms the meal.\nCourse Flow:\nMeals usually progress from light dishes (like sashimi) to grilled, simmered, and steamed items, ending with rice and dessert.\nWhy is Kaiseki Special in Kyoto?\nKyoto is considered the birthplace of Kaiseki, influenced by Zen Buddhist tea ceremony traditions and the citys long history as Japans cultural capital.\nKyotos geography is unique, as it is surrounded by fertile valleys, mountains, and rivers. This provides chefs with an abundance of seasonal produce, freshwater fish, and mountain herbs, all of which shape their seasonal menus. The result is a dining experience that feels both timeless and deeply connected to nature, which are very important aspects of kaiseki.\nMany Michelin-starred restaurants and historic ryotei (traditional dining houses) in Kyoto serve kaiseki, making it the best place in Japan to experience this culinary art.\nTips for Choosing & Booking Kaiseki\nWhile on a Budget\nBefore we get into the kaiseki restaurants we recommend, lets discuss how to choose the best kaiseki restaurant for you, based on your budget, the season, and style.\nDepending on what kind of experience you want, here are things to think about:\nTime of Day\nLunch Kaiseki (or small courses) are often more affordable, less formal, and still excellent. Dinner is more elaborate.\nLocation & Atmosphere\nIf you want old Kyoto, geisha-district ambience, teahouse-y streets, gardens, pick places in Higashiyama, Gion, Arashiyama.\nMenu Seasonality\nTry to visit when ingredients are at peak (e.g. autumn mushrooms, winter fish etc.). Many top places only operate with certain courses during certain seasons.\nMake Reservations Early\nEspecially for the high end ones, youll often need to book weeks in advance. Some require contact by phone/email ahead.\nBook Early:\nBudget-friendly kaiseki spots are popular and often require reservations, especially on weekends.\nConsider Shojin Ryori:\nVegetarian temple cuisine is a unique, affordable alternative to traditional kaiseki.\nKeep an Open Mind:\nKaiseki is about subtle flavors, not bold seasonings. Approach it as a cultural experience as much as a meal.\nDress & Etiquette\nAs these establishments are for fine dining, please make sure to:\nRefrain from\nwearing casual clothes such as shorts or tank tops.\nRefrain from\nwearing sports or gym clothes, such as yoga pants or sweatpants.\nWear\nsocks. Many of these restaurants have you take your shoes off. Sandals are not allowed.\nRefrain from\nwearing strong perfume or cologne.\nIf you do not follow these rules, you\nmay be denied entry\nupon arrival.\nTop 5 Budget-Friendly Kaiseki Restaurants in Kyoto\nGion Maruyama ()\nWhy its great:\nGion Maruyama is a well-regarded kaiseki restaurant located in the heart of Kyotos historic geisha district. Known for its refined yet welcoming atmosphere, it offers a classic kaiseki experience without the intimidating price tag of ultra-high-end establishments like Kitcho. They are also a child-friendly restaurant, as they have a special kaiseki set just for children.\nCost:\nLunch courses start at around 18,000, offering excellent value for the quality. Dinner is more expensive (30,000+ depending on the season) but still reasonable compared to other top-tier dinner kaiseki courses.\nAtmosphere:\nTraditional tatami rooms and serene interiors make it ideal for an authentic Kyoto dining experience. This is the best experience if you want to balance budget, traditional atmosphere, and experience.\nLocation:\nConveniently located in Gion, making it easy to combine with sightseeing at Yasaka Shrine or Hanamikoji Street. You might even see a geisha on your way!\nReservations:\nReservations are highly recommended. Please\nvisit their website and reserve HERE\n.\nVisit\nGion Maruyama HERE\n!\nKinobu ()\nWhy its great:\nEstablished in the early 20th century, Kinobu is a family-run kaiseki restaurant that blends tradition with a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Unlike the ultra-formal establishments, Kinobu makes fine dining approachable while preserving authenticity. They also offer vegetarian kaiseki in the form of shojin ryori, or buddhist monk cuisine.\nCost:\nTheir traditional kaiseki dinner ranges from 17,60034,100 depending on the season. However, if youre aiming for a lower budget, they do beautiful Kyoto bento box lunches for 4,95010,800 depending on the season.\nAtmosphere:\nA calm, elegant setting with seasonal decor that reflects Kyotos rich cultural heritage.\nLocation:\nCentrally located near Shijo, making it convenient for travelers staying in downtown Kyoto.\nReservations\n: Reservations are recommended, especially for dinner. Please make a reservation via their phone number listed on\ntheir website HERE\nat the bottom of the site. (Have your hotel receptionist make the call if you would rather not talk on the phone, they would be happy to book for you.)\nVisit\nKinobu HERE\n.\nKikunoi Roan ( )\nWhy its great:\nThis is the younger sibling of the world-famous Kikunoi restaurant. While Kikunois main location in Higashiyama is a three-star Michelin restaurant and extremely pricey, Roan Kikunoi offers a more relaxed and affordable way to enjoy the same philosophy of seasonal cuisine while still being a two-star Michelin restaurant.\nBudget Tip:\nLunch courses start at\n14,500\n, a fraction of what youd pay at the flagship restaurant. Dinner courses start at 24,000.\nAtmosphere:\nModern, casual elegance, but still refined. We believe this is the best restaurant for those looking for a beginner-friendly",

But what exactly is kaiseki? It is a multi-course haute cuisine rooted in respect for seasonality, ingredients, presentation, and ritual.\nKaiseki is more than just food. Its an experience: the sequence of courses, the setting (tatami room, garden view, etc.), the aesthetic of plating, and the hospitality (omotenashi). All this combined makes for a truly elevated and unforgettable experience.\nWhile its true that some of the most prestigious kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto can cost upwards of 50,000 per person, the good news is this: you dont need to spend a fortune to experience it.\nIn this guide, well introduce you to 5 of the best budget-friendly kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto. These places strike the perfect balance between authenticity, atmosphere, and affordability.\nWhether youre a first-time visitor, a foodie on a budget, or simply curious about Japanese haute cuisine, you can savor Kyotos culinary heritage without emptying your wallet.\nWhat is Kaiseki?\nKaiseki () is Japans most refined form of\nmulti-course dining, often compared to haute cuisine in the West.\nOriginating in Kyoto, Kaiseki showcases the seasonality of ingredients\n, artistic presentation, and a balance of taste, texture, and appearance. More than just a meal, it is a cultural journey through Japanese hospitality (\nomotenashi\n) and aesthetics.\nOnce reserved for the nobility and tea ceremonies, kaiseki has evolved into an art form that celebrates seasonality, presentation, and the harmony of flavors. Each dish is prepared with meticulous attention to detail, highlighting the natural flavors of seasonal ingredients. Presentation, plating, and the sequence of courses are as important as taste, creating a dining experience that feels more like an art performance than just a meal.\nKey Features of Kaiseki\nSeasonal Ingredients (Shun):\nEvery dish reflects the current season, from springs bamboo shoots to autumns matsutake mushrooms.\nArtful Presentation:\nPlates are chosen to complement the food, creating a harmony of color, shape, and design.\nDelicate Balance:\nKaiseki emphasizes subtle flavors, ensuring no one element overwhelms the meal.\nCourse Flow:\nMeals usually progress from light dishes (like sashimi) to grilled, simmered, and steamed items, ending with rice and dessert.\nWhy is Kaiseki Special in Kyoto?\nKyoto is considered the birthplace of Kaiseki, influenced by Zen Buddhist tea ceremony traditions and the citys long history as Japans cultural capital.\nKyotos geography is unique, as it is surrounded by fertile valleys, mountains, and rivers. This provides chefs with an abundance of seasonal produce, freshwater fish, and mountain herbs, all of which shape their seasonal menus. The result is a dining experience that feels both timeless and deeply connected to nature, which are very important aspects of kaiseki.\nMany Michelin-starred restaurants and historic ryotei (traditional dining houses) in Kyoto serve kaiseki, making it the best place in Japan to experience this culinary art.\nTips for Choosing & Booking Kaiseki\nWhile on a Budget\nBefore we get into the kaiseki restaurants we recommend, lets discuss how to choose the best kaiseki restaurant for you, based on your budget, the season, and style.\nDepending on what kind of experience you want, here are things to think about:\nTime of Day\nLunch Kaiseki (or small courses) are often more affordable, less formal, and still excellent. Dinner is more elaborate.\nLocation & Atmosphere\nIf you want old Kyoto, geisha-district ambience, teahouse-y streets, gardens, pick places in Higashiyama, Gion, Arashiyama.\nMenu Seasonality\nTry to visit when ingredients are at peak (e.g. autumn mushrooms, winter fish etc.). Many top places only operate with certain courses during certain seasons.\nMake Reservations Early\nEspecially for the high end ones, youll often need to book weeks in advance. Some require contact by phone/email ahead.\nBook Early:\nBudget-friendly kaiseki spots are popular and often require reservations, especially on weekends.\nConsider Shojin Ryori:\nVegetarian temple cuisine is a unique, affordable alternative to traditional kaiseki.\nKeep an Open Mind:\nKaiseki is about subtle flavors, not bold seasonings. Approach it as a cultural experience as much as a meal.\nDress & Etiquette\nAs these establishments are for fine dining, please make sure to:\nRefrain from\nwearing casual clothes such as shorts or tank tops.\nRefrain from\nwearing sports or gym clothes, such as yoga pants or sweatpants.\nWear\nsocks. Many of these restaurants have you take your shoes off. Sandals are not allowed.\nRefrain from\nwearing strong perfume or cologne.\nIf you do not follow these rules, you\nmay be denied entry\nupon arrival.\nTop 5 Budget-Friendly Kaiseki Restaurants in Kyoto\nGion Maruyama ()\nWhy its great:\nGion Maruyama is a well-regarded kaiseki restaurant located in the heart of Kyotos historic geisha district. Known for its refined yet welcoming atmosphere, it offers a classic kaiseki experience without the intimidating price tag of ultra-high-end establishments like Kitcho. They are also a child-friendly restaurant, as they have a special kaiseki set just for children.\nCost:\nLunch courses start at around 18,000, offering excellent value for the quality. Dinner is more expensive (30,000+ depending on the season) but still reasonable compared to other top-tier dinner kaiseki courses.\nAtmosphere:\nTraditional tatami rooms and serene interiors make it ideal for an authentic Kyoto dining experience. This is the best experience if you want to balance budget, traditional atmosphere, and experience.\nLocation:\nConveniently located in Gion, making it easy to combine with sightseeing at Yasaka Shrine or Hanamikoji Street. You might even see a geisha on your way!\nReservations:\nReservations are highly recommended. Please\nvisit their website and reserve HERE\n.\nVisit\nGion Maruyama HERE\n!\nKinobu ()\nWhy its great:\nEstablished in the early 20th century, Kinobu is a family-run kaiseki restaurant that blends tradition with a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Unlike the ultra-formal establishments, Kinobu makes fine dining approachable while preserving authenticity. They also offer vegetarian kaiseki in the form of shojin ryori, or buddhist monk cuisine.\nCost:\nTheir traditional kaiseki dinner ranges from 17,60034,100 depending on the season. However, if youre aiming for a lower budget, they do beautiful Kyoto bento box lunches for 4,95010,800 depending on the season.\nAtmosphere:\nA calm, elegant setting with seasonal decor that reflects Kyotos rich cultural heritage.\nLocation:\nCentrally located near Shijo, making it convenient for travelers staying in downtown Kyoto.\nReservations\n: Reservations are recommended, especially for dinner. Please make a reservation via their phone number listed on\ntheir website HERE\nat the bottom of the site. (Have your hotel receptionist make the call if you would rather not talk on the phone, they would be happy to book for you.)\nVisit\nKinobu HERE\n.\nKikunoi Roan ( )\nWhy its great:\nThis is the younger sibling of the world-famous Kikunoi restaurant. While Kikunois main location in Higashiyama is a three-star Michelin restaurant and extremely pricey, Roan Kikunoi offers a more relaxed and affordable way to enjoy the same philosophy of seasonal cuisine while still being a two-star Michelin restaurant.\nBudget Tip:\nLunch courses start at\n14,500\n, a fraction of what youd pay at the flagship restaurant. Dinner courses start at 24,000.\nAtmosphere:\nModern, casual elegance, but still refined. We believe this is the best restaurant for those looking for a beginner-friendly",

But what exactly is kaiseki? It is a multi-course haute cuisine rooted in respect for seasonality, ingredients, presentation, and ritual.\nKaiseki is more than just food. Its an experience: the sequence of courses, the setting (tatami room, garden view, etc.), the aesthetic of plating, and the hospitality (omotenashi). All this combined makes for a truly elevated and unforgettable experience.\nWhile its true that some of the most prestigious kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto can cost upwards of 50,000 per person, the good news is this: you dont need to spend a fortune to experience it.\nIn this guide, well introduce you to 5 of the best budget-friendly kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto. These places strike the perfect balance between authenticity, atmosphere, and affordability.\nWhether youre a first-time visitor, a foodie on a budget, or simply curious about Japanese haute cuisine, you can savor Kyotos culinary heritage without emptying your wallet.\nWhat is Kaiseki?\nKaiseki () is Japans most refined form of\nmulti-course dining, often compared to haute cuisine in the West.\nOriginating in Kyoto, Kaiseki showcases the seasonality of ingredients\n, artistic presentation, and a balance of taste, texture, and appearance. More than just a meal, it is a cultural journey through Japanese hospitality (\nomotenashi\n) and aesthetics.\nOnce reserved for the nobility and tea ceremonies, kaiseki has evolved into an art form that celebrates seasonality, presentation, and the harmony of flavors. Each dish is prepared with meticulous attention to detail, highlighting the natural flavors of seasonal ingredients. Presentation, plating, and the sequence of courses are as important as taste, creating a dining experience that feels more like an art performance than just a meal.\nKey Features of Kaiseki\nSeasonal Ingredients (Shun):\nEvery dish reflects the current season, from springs bamboo shoots to autumns matsutake mushrooms.\nArtful Presentation:\nPlates are chosen to complement the food, creating a harmony of color, shape, and design.\nDelicate Balance:\nKaiseki emphasizes subtle flavors, ensuring no one element overwhelms the meal.\nCourse Flow:\nMeals usually progress from light dishes (like sashimi) to grilled, simmered, and steamed items, ending with rice and dessert.\nWhy is Kaiseki Special in Kyoto?\nKyoto is considered the birthplace of Kaiseki, influenced by Zen Buddhist tea ceremony traditions and the citys long history as Japans cultural capital.\nKyotos geography is unique, as it is surrounded by fertile valleys, mountains, and rivers. This provides chefs with an abundance of seasonal produce, freshwater fish, and mountain herbs, all of which shape their seasonal menus. The result is a dining experience that feels both timeless and deeply connected to nature, which are very important aspects of kaiseki.\nMany Michelin-starred restaurants and historic ryotei (traditional dining houses) in Kyoto serve kaiseki, making it the best place in Japan to experience this culinary art.\nTips for Choosing & Booking Kaiseki\nWhile on a Budget\nBefore we get into the kaiseki restaurants we recommend, lets discuss how to choose the best kaiseki restaurant for you, based on your budget, the season, and style.\nDepending on what kind of experience you want, here are things to think about:\nTime of Day\nLunch Kaiseki (or small courses) are often more affordable, less formal, and still excellent. Dinner is more elaborate.\nLocation & Atmosphere\nIf you want old Kyoto, geisha-district ambience, teahouse-y streets, gardens, pick places in Higashiyama, Gion, Arashiyama.\nMenu Seasonality\nTry to visit when ingredients are at peak (e.g. autumn mushrooms, winter fish etc.). Many top places only operate with certain courses during certain seasons.\nMake Reservations Early\nEspecially for the high end ones, youll often need to book weeks in advance. Some require contact by phone/email ahead.\nBook Early:\nBudget-friendly kaiseki spots are popular and often require reservations, especially on weekends.\nConsider Shojin Ryori:\nVegetarian temple cuisine is a unique, affordable alternative to traditional kaiseki.\nKeep an Open Mind:\nKaiseki is about subtle flavors, not bold seasonings. Approach it as a cultural experience as much as a meal.\nDress & Etiquette\nAs these establishments are for fine dining, please make sure to:\nRefrain from\nwearing casual clothes such as shorts or tank tops.\nRefrain from\nwearing sports or gym clothes, such as yoga pants or sweatpants.\nWear\nsocks. Many of these restaurants have you take your shoes off. Sandals are not allowed.\nRefrain from\nwearing strong perfume or cologne.\nIf you do not follow these rules, you\nmay be denied entry\nupon arrival.\nTop 5 Budget-Friendly Kaiseki Restaurants in Kyoto\nGion Maruyama ()\nWhy its great:\nGion Maruyama is a well-regarded kaiseki restaurant located in the heart of Kyotos historic geisha district. Known for its refined yet welcoming atmosphere, it offers a classic kaiseki experience without the intimidating price tag of ultra-high-end establishments like Kitcho. They are also a child-friendly restaurant, as they have a special kaiseki set just for children.\nCost:\nLunch courses start at around 18,000, offering excellent value for the quality. Dinner is more expensive (30,000+ depending on the season) but still reasonable compared to other top-tier dinner kaiseki courses.\nAtmosphere:\nTraditional tatami rooms and serene interiors make it ideal for an authentic Kyoto dining experience. This is the best experience if you want to balance budget, traditional atmosphere, and experience.\nLocation:\nConveniently located in Gion, making it easy to combine with sightseeing at Yasaka Shrine or Hanamikoji Street.

While Kikunois main location in Higashiyama is a three-star Michelin restaurant and extremely pricey, Roan Kikunoi offers a more relaxed and affordable way to enjoy the same philosophy of seasonal cuisine while still being a two-star Michelin restaurant.\nBudget Tip:\nLunch courses start at\n14,500\n, a fraction of what youd pay at the flagship restaurant. Dinner courses start at 24,000.\nAtmosphere:\nModern, casual elegance, but still refined. We believe this is the best restaurant for those looking for a beginner-friendly",

There are also plenty of photo spots, including views looking up from beneath the stage and capturing cherry blossoms through the corridors.

The\nworld famous attractions\nare spread across the city, and you dont want to waste time trekking back and forth. So to save you the trouble, heres everything you need to know about transport in Kyoto.\nJump to:\nThe basics\nTrain\nSubway\nBus\nCycling\nWalking\nTravel passes\nFrequently asked questions\nThe basics of getting around in Kyoto\nKyoto City map.\n|Photo by Japan Cheapo\nThere are quite a few different transport options in Kyoto and\na whole lot of things to do\nspread across the city.\nPublic transport options like trains, buses, and subways all accept IC transport cards. The local transport card is called the ICOCA but Tokyos\nSUICA\nand\nPASMO\ntransport cards are also accepted. JR train lines stop at\nKyoto Station\n, and so does the Shinkansen. If youre\ntraveling from Tokyo to Kyoto\nby Shinkansen, this is where youll get off. Some subway lines and bus routes also stop at Kyoto Station, but a number of other subway and private train lines do not.\nSuggested Activity\nBrunch at Nishiki Market in Kyoto\nStart your day the right way -- with a delicious brunch in \"Kyoto's kitchen\", also known as Nishiki Market. The market has a long history, going back more than 400 years.\nClick here for details\nNavigating Kyoto is easy as the city is laid-out in a grid with streets running north to south, and east to west. Its also fairly flat so walking and cycling is certainly possible.\nNeed help navigating Kyoto Station? Then check out our\nKyoto Station survival guide\n.\nKyoto Station\nAddress:\nHigashishiokoji Kamadonocho, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture 600-0000, Japan\nRead more\nTake the train\nThere are so many train lines in Kyoto that it can get a bit overwhelming. However, the key thing to understand is that there are JR train lines and private train company lines. Each train company has different fee systems, and might not accept certain passes. For example, you usually cant use a\nJR Pass\non a private train line. An IC card can be used on both private and JR lines. There are some trains and stations that dont accept IC cards, but they are fairly out-of-the-way for most tourists. Also keep in mind that not all train lines pass through Kyoto Station.\nFushimi Inari Shrine can be reached by train.|Photo by Getty Images.\nIn general, you will only take the train in Kyoto if youre traveling further afield. For example, you could take a train for a\nday trip to Nara\n. Most major attractions in Kyoto dont have train stations nearby, except for\nFushimi Inari Shrine\nand\nArashiyama\n.\nRide the subway\nKyoto has two subway lines which are part of the Kyoto Municipal Subway. The Karasuma Line runs north-south from Kokusaikaikan Station through Kyoto Station and on to Takeda Station. It can get you to places like\nGosho Imperial Palace\nand\nKyoto Botancial Gardens\n.\nRide the subway to Nij Castle.\n|Photo by iStock.com/coward_lion\nThe other subway line is the Tzai Line which runs east-west from Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station to Rokujizo Station. Attractions along the Tzai Line include\nNij Castle\nand the\nHigashiyama district\n.\nThe two subway lines intersect at Karasuma Oike Station. There are also a few stations where you can transfer between the subway and trains, including Kyoto Station, Nij Station, and Misasagi Station.\nSuggested Activity\nHighly Recommended Osaka Food Tour\nBook this best-selling tour and see why Osaka is known as Japan's kitchen. Taste famous dishes like okonomiyaki, kushikatsu and more, with a friendly local guide.\nClick here for details\nCatch a bus\nBuses are a convenient way to get around in Kyoto. In fact, there is at least one bus stop near most major attractions. Read our guide to\nTraveling Around Kyoto by Bus\nfor more details.\nHowever, do keep in mind that\novercrowding on buses has been causing problems for locals\n. If youre traveling with large suitcases, wed encourage you to use alternative methods of transport.\nCycle around\nKyoto is a relatively flat city, so its great for cycling. You can either\njoin a bike tour\n, or\nrent a bike\n, the choice is yours. Just make sure you follow the local laws and road safety rules to avoid any trouble. You should ride on the left-hand side of the road and if a sidewalk has a bike lane, you can ride there too. We also recommend against parking anywhere that has a  sign  it means no bicycle parking. Of course, youll probably see plenty of local cyclists breaking these rules, but its best to play it safe.\nGo for a walk\nWalking is the ultimate Cheapo mode of transport and Kyoto is a very walkable city. The city is fairly flat and the roads use a grid system, so its comfortable for strolling and you dont need to worry about getting lost. Major roads have clearly marked footpaths, but if you walk along residential streets youll be sharing the path with cars and cyclists. Dont let that discourage you though, its quite safe as long as you keep an eye out for oncoming traffic.\nThe Philosophers Path in the spring.|Photo by Getty Images\nKeep in mind that Kyotos attractions are quite spread out. We recommend picking a neighborhood to wander around, rather than trying to trek between attractions at different ends of the city.\nThe Philosophers Path\nis ideal for a quiet stroll, or head to Gion for\ngeisha spotting\n. Those who prefer walking with purpose to meandering, should consider\njoining a walking tour\n.\nSuggested Activity\nUniversal Studios Japan Tickets\nIf you want to get ahead of the game and run straight to the rides, getting your tickets through an authorized and international seller like Klook is the way to go.\nClick here for details\nTravel passes and discounts for Kyoto\nThere is a huge variety of\nKyoto travel passes\navailable. We like the Skyhop: Hop-on Hop-off Sightseeing Bus because it has a multi-lingual audio guide and you can\nbuy passes online\n. If youre just planning a day trip from Osaka, the\nKyoto-Osaka Sightseeing Pass\nor the\nHankyu Tourist Pass\nare good options.\nFrequently asked questions\nCan you take a taxi in Kyoto?\nYes, you definitely can. However, its usually an expensive option, unless youre traveling in a group. There are taxi stands outside most stations, otherwise you can hail one in the street.\nWhats the best way of getting around in Kyoto?\nTheres no single answer to this because it really depends on where youd like to go. You can take the train, subway, bus, or even walk or cycle to lots of attractions in Kyoto.\nCan you catch an Uber in Kyoto?\nYou can catch an Uber or other ride-share service in Kyoto, but theyre not exactly the same as in other countries. Ride-shares in Japan are basically just taxi booking services. And theyre not necessarily cheaper than hailing a regular taxi.\nWhile we do our best to ensure its correct, information is subject to change.\nOpen with Maps\nWritten by:\nMaria Danuco\nMaria's Japan favorites are:\nFukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum\n,\nFushimi Inari Shrine\nFiled under:\nTravel\nTags:\nTransport\nTransportation\nGet the best Japan Cheapo hacks direct to your inbox\nSubscribe\nRelated Posts\nMore Posts\n11 Best Places to See Cherry Blossoms in Japan\nJanuary 27th, 2026 ",

There are three main bus operators in the city:\n- Kyoto City Transportation Bureau (pale green)\n- Keihan Bus (red and white)\n- JR West Japan Bus (white and blue)\nEach operates different routes.\nKyoto City Subway: For Fast Travel Within Kyoto City\nPhoto by Pixta\nKyoto has a fast subway system consisting of the North-South Line and the East-West Line, forming a cross-shaped network.\nThe North-South Line is connected to the Kintetsu Nara Line, while the East-West Line connects to the Keihan Otsu Line. The starting fare for the Kyoto subway is 220 yen, with a maximum fare of 360 yen based on the distance.\nShijo Station and Karasuma Oike Station are bustling central locations in Kyoto, while Nijojo-mae Station is right next to Nijo Castle, a World Heritage Site.\nRead also\nNijo Castle: Highlights, Seasonal Events, and Budget-Friendly Tickets\nKyoto\nHigashiyama Station provides easy access to Heian Shrine. However, if you plan to explore Kyoto thoroughly, relying solely on the subway may be challenging because most subway stations are some distance away from the major attractions. We would suggest using both the subway and local buses to quickly reach your destination.\nRecommended Discount Ticket: Kyoto Subway and Bus 1-Day Pass\nIf you plan to take the Kyoto subway and buses, it's recommended to use the\nSubway and Bus 1-Day Pass\n, priced at 1,100 yen. After a few rides, you'll already break even!\nFrom fall 2023, the sale of the Bus One-Day Pass will be discontinued. However, unused passes can be used until the spring of 2024, after which they will no longer be valid.\n2-Day Pass for Kyoto and Osaka!

Depending on the situation, using a taxi can also be a good choice!\nRead also\nJapan's Best Taxi Apps in English: GO, Grab, Uber, and More\nJR West Japan Trains: For Trips to Neighboring Cities\nPhoto by Pixta\nWhile JR West Japan's coverage within Kyoto City is limited, you can take their trains to go from Kyoto Station to Saga Arashiyama Station or Nijo Station. If you're heading to these destinations, taking the JR train is faster than the bus and reasonably priced.\nAlso, you'll be using the JR-West lines if you plan to visit attractions areas in northern Kyoto Prefecture such as Amanohashidate or Maizuru.\nBook the JR West Kansai Wide Area Pass (5 days)\nHankyu Railway: For Trips from Shijo Station to Osaka and Kobe\nPhoto by Pixta\nHankyu Railway is a suitable transportation option for journeys to Osaka or Kobe.\nHowever, when traveling from Kawaramachi to Arashiyama, most people choose to take the train to Katsura Station and transfer to the Arashiyama Line to reach Arashiyama Station, which is very close to the Togetsukyo Bridge.\nAnother way to use the Hankyu Railway lines is to travel from Kyoto's Kawaramachi Station to Karasuma Station, which is much faster than walking, making it suitable for those in a hurry.\n Return to the top of article.\nCost-effective and Convenient! The Hankyu One-Day and Two-Day Pass\nPictures courtesy of\nTravelearth/\nFor visitors to Japan, we recommend the\nHankyu Tourist Pass\n.\nThis pass is available as a one-day pass (700 yen) and a non-consecutive two-day pass (1,200 yen), and it is very convenient.\nWe highly recommend purchasing this pass because Hankyu Railway fares are generally quite affordable. Traveling from Osaka's Umeda Station to Kyoto's Kawaramachi Station or Kobe's Sannomiya on these \"long-distance trains\" alone makes it cost-effective.\nIf you have stops along the way or take longer journeys (e.g., from Kyoto Kawaramachi to Kobe Sannomiya), it becomes even more cost-effective.\nBook the Hankyu Tourist Pass\nKeihan Railway: For Trips from Kamogawa East Side to Osaka\nKeihan Railway primarily operates on the east side of Kyoto City. When traveling from areas like Demachiyanagi, Shijo, and Sanjo to the southern Fushimi area in the city center, taking the Keihan Railway is the fastest way.\nIf you're heading to places like Kyobashi or Yodobashi in Osaka, riding the Keihan Railway is the quickest option.\nSpecial Discount Tickets for Foreign Visitors\nPicture courtesy of\nflyinghsuan\nKeihan Railway offers one-day and two-day passes for its entire network, as well as expanded versions that include the Osaka Subway and Eizan Electric Railway. You can choose one according to your travel needs!\nIf you want to visit multiple attractions in one day, we recommend the Kyoto and Osaka Sightseeing Pass (overseas price: 900 yen), which is a very cost-effective ticket.\nIt allows you to start your journey from the center of Osaka and is a great choice because there are not many stations between the attractions along the Keihan Railway line. The starting fare on this line for just one station is 220 yen, so taking the train four times in one day will already make it worth the cost.\nBook the Kyoto & Osaka Sightseeing Pass\n Return to the top of article.\nEizan Electric Railway: For Trips to Ichijoji, Kibune, and Mount Kurama\nPhoto by Pixta\nTo travel from Demachiyanagi Station to Ichijoji, Kibune, and Mount Kurama, taking the Eizan Electric Railway is the fastest way!\nDuring the autumn foliage season, some sections are illuminated at night, and by boarding the trains shown in the pictures, you can enjoy the breathtaking view of maple leaves beautifully lit up through the large windows, making it feel like stepping into a fantasy world.\nCharming Streetcars: Keifuku Electric Railroad\nPhoto by Pixta\nThe Keifuku Electric Railroad, also known as Randen, is a railway line that runs from Shijo-Omiya Station to Arashiyama.\nThe Kitano Line passes by famous temples like Ryoanji and Jikkoin, while the Arashiyama Line goes by Hirokoji Temple and Togetsu Temple, offering a rich array of attractions along its route.\nThe annual limited-time Yokai Tram ev",

With its breathtaking temples, serene gardens, and vibrant cultural scene, Kyoto is a destination that seamlessly blends the past with the present. However, navigating this megacity can be daunting, especially for first-time visitors. In this article, well delve into the best ways to explore Kyoto, from its efficient public transportation system to its most authentic neighborhoods.\nGetting Around Kyoto: A Guide to Public Transportation\nKyoto is a sprawling city with 1.5 million inhabitants, making it impossible to visit everything on foot. The general advice is to use a combination of buses and trains to move around the city efficiently. For a first impression, consider taking a guided tour of the city, which will help you get familiar with the landmarks and identify reference points.\nHow to Get to Kyoto from Kansai Osaka Airport\nSince Kyoto does not have an airport, the most convenient way to reach the city is by taking the Haruka Express train from Kansai International Airport (KIX). This train connects the airport to Kyoto Station in just 78 minutes, and tickets can be booked online. Alternatively, you can take a bus or book a private transfer.\nHow to Get to Kyoto from Tokyo\nKyoto is approximately 500 km away from Tokyo, but its well-connected by the Tkaid Shinkansen line.

Bike rental shops like Carillon offer affordable rates, with 24-hour rentals starting at 500.\nBe careful where you leave your bike, as its forbidden on the road, at train stations, or in city centers. Designated parking lots (150 for 8 hours) are available for bikes.\nConsider taking a guided bike tour to navigate efficiently and safely.\nTaxi\nTaxis may seem like an unusual option in Kyoto, but they can be cost-effective, especially if youre traveling with others.\nOpt for tourist-friendly taxis with the phrase foreigner friendly written on them to communicate in English with the driver. The light turns red when youre looking, green or blue means its occupied.\nConclusion\nKyoto is a city that seamlessly blends tradition and modernity, offering something for everyone.

The\nworld famous attractions\nare spread across the city, and you dont want to waste time trekking back and forth. So to save you the trouble, heres everything you need to know about transport in Kyoto.\nJump to:\nThe basics\nTrain\nSubway\nBus\nCycling\nWalking\nTravel passes\nFrequently asked questions\nThe basics of getting around in Kyoto\nKyoto City map.\n|Photo by Japan Cheapo\nThere are quite a few different transport options in Kyoto and\na whole lot of things to do\nspread across the city.\nPublic transport options like trains, buses, and subways all accept IC transport cards. The local transport card is called the ICOCA but Tokyos\nSUICA\nand\nPASMO\ntransport cards are also accepted. JR train lines stop at\nKyoto Station\n, and so does the Shinkansen. If youre\ntraveling from Tokyo to Kyoto\nby Shinkansen, this is where youll get off. Some subway lines and bus routes also stop at Kyoto Station, but a number of other subway and private train lines do not.\nSuggested Activity\nBrunch at Nishiki Market in Kyoto\nStart your day the right way -- with a delicious brunch in \"Kyoto's kitchen\", also known as Nishiki Market. The market has a long history, going back more than 400 years.\nClick here for details\nNavigating Kyoto is easy as the city is laid-out in a grid with streets running north to south, and east to west. Its also fairly flat so walking and cycling is certainly possible.\nNeed help navigating Kyoto Station? Then check out our\nKyoto Station survival guide\n.\nKyoto Station\nAddress:\nHigashishiokoji Kamadonocho, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture 600-0000, Japan\nRead more\nTake the train\nThere are so many train lines in Kyoto that it can get a bit overwhelming. However, the key thing to understand is that there are JR train lines and private train company lines. Each train company has different fee systems, and might not accept certain passes. For example, you usually cant use a\nJR Pass\non a private train line. An IC card can be used on both private and JR lines. There are some trains and stations that dont accept IC cards, but they are fairly out-of-the-way for most tourists. Also keep in mind that not all train lines pass through Kyoto Station.\nFushimi Inari Shrine can be reached by train.|Photo by Getty Images.\nIn general, you will only take the train in Kyoto if youre traveling further afield. For example, you could take a train for a\nday trip to Nara\n. Most major attractions in Kyoto dont have train stations nearby, except for\nFushimi Inari Shrine\nand\nArashiyama\n.\nRide the subway\nKyoto has two subway lines which are part of the Kyoto Municipal Subway. The Karasuma Line runs north-south from Kokusaikaikan Station through Kyoto Station and on to Takeda Station. It can get you to places like\nGosho Imperial Palace\nand\nKyoto Botancial Gardens\n.\nRide the subway to Nij Castle.\n|Photo by iStock.com/coward_lion\nThe other subway line is the Tzai Line which runs east-west from Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station to Rokujizo Station. Attractions along the Tzai Line include\nNij Castle\nand the\nHigashiyama district\n.\nThe two subway lines intersect at Karasuma Oike Station. There are also a few stations where you can transfer between the subway and trains, including Kyoto Station, Nij Station, and Misasagi Station.\nSuggested Activity\nHighly Recommended Osaka Food Tour\nBook this best-selling tour and see why Osaka is known as Japan's kitchen. Taste famous dishes like okonomiyaki, kushikatsu and more, with a friendly local guide.\nClick here for details\nCatch a bus\nBuses are a convenient way to get around in Kyoto. In fact, there is at least one bus stop near most major attractions. Read our guide to\nTraveling Around Kyoto by Bus\nfor more details.\nHowever, do keep in mind that\novercrowding on buses has been causing problems for locals\n. If youre traveling with large suitcases, wed encourage you to use alternative methods of transport.\nCycle around\nKyoto is a relatively flat city, so its great for cycling. You can either\njoin a bike tour\n, or\nrent a bike\n, the choice is yours. Just make sure you follow the local laws and road safety rules to avoid any trouble. You should ride on the left-hand side of the road and if a sidewalk has a bike lane, you can ride there too. We also recommend against parking anywhere that has a  sign  it means no bicycle parking. Of course, youll probably see plenty of local cyclists breaking these rules, but its best to play it safe.\nGo for a walk\nWalking is the ultimate Cheapo mode of transport and Kyoto is a very walkable city. The city is fairly flat and the roads use a grid system, so its comfortable for strolling and you dont need to worry about getting lost. Major roads have clearly marked footpaths, but if you walk along residential streets youll be sharing the path with cars and cyclists. Dont let that discourage you though, its quite safe as long as you keep an eye out for oncoming traffic.\nThe Philosophers Path in the spring.|Photo by Getty Images\nKeep in mind that Kyotos attractions are quite spread out. We recommend picking a neighborhood to wander around, rather than trying to trek between attractions at different ends of the city.\nThe Philosophers Path\nis ideal for a quiet stroll, or head to Gion for\ngeisha spotting\n. Those who prefer walking with purpose to meandering, should consider\njoining a walking tour\n.\nSuggested Activity\nUniversal Studios Japan Tickets\nIf you want to get ahead of the game and run straight to the rides, getting your tickets through an authorized and international seller like Klook is the way to go.\nClick here for details\nTravel passes and discounts for Kyoto\nThere is a huge variety of\nKyoto travel passes\navailable. We like the Skyhop: Hop-on Hop-off Sightseeing Bus because it has a multi-lingual audio guide and you can\nbuy passes online\n. If youre just planning a day trip from Osaka, the\nKyoto-Osaka Sightseeing Pass\nor the\nHankyu Tourist Pass\nare good options.\nFrequently asked questions\nCan you take a taxi in Kyoto?\nYes, you definitely can. However, its usually an expensive option, unless youre traveling in a group. There are taxi stands outside most stations, otherwise you can hail one in the street.\nWhats the best way of getting around in Kyoto?\nTheres no single answer to this because it really depends on where youd like to go. You can take the train, subway, bus, or even walk or cycle to lots of attractions in Kyoto.\nCan you catch an Uber in Kyoto?\nYou can catch an Uber or other ride-share service in Kyoto, but theyre not exactly the same as in other countries. Ride-shares in Japan are basically just taxi booking services. And theyre not necessarily cheaper than hailing a regular taxi.\nWhile we do our best to ensure its correct, information is subject to change.\nOpen with Maps\nWritten by:\nMaria Danuco\nMaria's Japan favorites are:\nFukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum\n,\nFushimi Inari Shrine\nFiled under:\nTravel\nTags:\nTransport\nTransportation\nGet the best Japan Cheapo hacks direct to your inbox\nSubscribe\nRelated Posts\nMore Posts\n11 Best Places to See Cherry Blossoms in Japan\nJanuary 27th, 2026 ",

Depending on where you wish to travel next, you might need to use a combination of transportation means.\nThere are several discount passes for visitors to Japan that you can use for cost-effective travel.

There are three main bus operators in the city:\n- Kyoto City Transportation Bureau (pale green)\n- Keihan Bus (red and white)\n- JR West Japan Bus (white and blue)\nEach operates different routes.\nKyoto City Subway: For Fast Travel Within Kyoto City\nPhoto by Pixta\nKyoto has a fast subway system consisting of the North-South Line and the East-West Line, forming a cross-shaped network.\nThe North-South Line is connected to the Kintetsu Nara Line, while the East-West Line connects to the Keihan Otsu Line. The starting fare for the Kyoto subway is 220 yen, with a maximum fare of 360 yen based on the distance.\nShijo Station and Karasuma Oike Station are bustling central locations in Kyoto, while Nijojo-mae Station is right next to Nijo Castle, a World Heritage Site.\nRead also\nNijo Castle: Highlights, Seasonal Events, and Budget-Friendly Tickets\nKyoto\nHigashiyama Station provides easy access to Heian Shrine. However, if you plan to explore Kyoto thoroughly, relying solely on the subway may be challenging because most subway stations are some distance away from the major attractions. We would suggest using both the subway and local buses to quickly reach your destination.\nRecommended Discount Ticket: Kyoto Subway and Bus 1-Day Pass\nIf you plan to take the Kyoto subway and buses, it's recommended to use the\nSubway and Bus 1-Day Pass\n, priced at 1,100 yen. After a few rides, you'll already break even!\nFrom fall 2023, the sale of the Bus One-Day Pass will be discontinued. However, unused passes can be used until the spring of 2024, after which they will no longer be valid.\n2-Day Pass for Kyoto and Osaka!

If you're heading to these destinations, taking the JR train is faster than the bus and reasonably priced.\nAlso, you'll be using the JR-West lines if you plan to visit attractions areas in northern Kyoto Prefecture such as Amanohashidate or Maizuru.\nBook the JR West Kansai Wide Area Pass (5 days)\nHankyu Railway: For Trips from Shijo Station to Osaka and Kobe\nPhoto by Pixta\nHankyu Railway is a suitable transportation option for journeys to Osaka or Kobe.\nHowever, when traveling from Kawaramachi to Arashiyama, most people choose to take the train to Katsura Station and transfer to the Arashiyama Line to reach Arashiyama Station, which is very close to the Togetsukyo Bridge.\nAnother way to use the Hankyu Railway lines is to travel from Kyoto's Kawaramachi Station to Karasuma Station, which is much faster than walking, making it suitable for those in a hurry.\n Return to the top of article.\nCost-effective and Convenient! The Hankyu One-Day and Two-Day Pass\nPictures courtesy of\nTravelearth/\nFor visitors to Japan, we recommend the\nHankyu Tourist Pass\n.\nThis pass is available as a one-day pass (700 yen) and a non-consecutive two-day pass (1,200 yen), and it is very convenient.\nWe highly recommend purchasing this pass because Hankyu Railway fares are generally quite affordable. Traveling from Osaka's Umeda Station to Kyoto's Kawaramachi Station or Kobe's Sannomiya on these \"long-distance trains\" alone makes it cost-effective.\nIf you have stops along the way or take longer journeys (e.g., from Kyoto Kawaramachi to Kobe Sannomiya), it becomes even more cost-effective.\nBook the Hankyu Tourist Pass\nKeihan Railway: For Trips from Kamogawa East Side to Osaka\nKeihan Railway primarily operates on the east side of Kyoto City. When traveling from areas like Demachiyanagi, Shijo, and Sanjo to the southern Fushimi area in the city center, taking the Keihan Railway is the fastest way.\nIf you're heading to places like Kyobashi or Yodobashi in Osaka, riding the Keihan Railway is the quickest option.\nSpecial Discount Tickets for Foreign Visitors\nPicture courtesy of\nflyinghsuan\nKeihan Railway offers one-day and two-day passes for its entire network, as well as expanded versions that include the Osaka Subway and Eizan Electric Railway. You can choose one according to your travel needs!\nIf you want to visit multiple attractions in one day, we recommend the Kyoto and Osaka Sightseeing Pass (overseas price: 900 yen), which is a very cost-effective ticket.\nIt allows you to start your journey from the center of Osaka and is a great choice because there are not many stations between the attractions along the Keihan Railway line. The starting fare on this line for just one station is 220 yen, so taking the train four times in one day will already make it worth the cost.\nBook the Kyoto & Osaka Sightseeing Pass\n Return to the top of article.\nEizan Electric Railway: For Trips to Ichijoji, Kibune, and Mount Kurama\nPhoto by Pixta\nTo travel from Demachiyanagi Station to Ichijoji, Kibune, and Mount Kurama, taking the Eizan Electric Railway is the fastest way!\nDuring the autumn foliage season, some sections are illuminated at night, and by boarding the trains shown in the pictures, you can enjoy the breathtaking view of maple leaves beautifully lit up through the large windows, making it feel like stepping into a fantasy world.\nCharming Streetcars: Keifuku Electric Railroad\nPhoto by Pixta\nThe Keifuku Electric Railroad, also known as Randen, is a railway line that runs from Shijo-Omiya Station to Arashiyama.\nThe Kitano Line passes by famous temples like Ryoanji and Jikkoin, while the Arashiyama Line goes by Hirokoji Temple and Togetsu Temple, offering a rich array of attractions along its route.\nThe annual limited-time Yokai Tram ev",

When spring rolls around there, it looks incredibly beautiful and lets visitors to enjoy the surrounding breathtaking spring landscapes. There are so many temples & shrines, old streets, stores, restaurants and also the parks to enjoy.\nIts a famous destination to visit for almost every Japan enthusiast. Are you one of them who want to explore Kyotos spring beauty this year during the hanami? Please take a look at\nthis years cherry blossom forecast\nbefore I take you to most of the notable places across Kyoto.\nAccording to Japan Cherry Blossom Forecast, Kyoto is at its best in\nearly April\n. But this year, sakura season will arrive earlier!\nVisitors walking along the Tetsugaku-no-michi during hanami. Photo Credit: pelican at Flickr.\nKyoto is always packed with endless discoveries whenever you take a trip to this awe-inspiring place, and often you would have to rethink should I visit this one first or that one?\nMy intention here is to keep you stress free with giving more comfort while exploring the cherry blossom spots including the other famous sightseeing attractions spread across Kyoto.\nThis\nKyoto-4 Day itinerary\nsurely offers you the most exciting things to do and see in the spring. Whether you visit Kyoto from either Osaka or Tokyo, make sure you dont miss the full bloom period. Thats the important thing you should always keep in mind above all.\nWhen you follow this itinerary, make sure you decide to stay overnight in a hotel located nearby\nKyoto Station\n.\nThis hotel\ncan be a perfect choice! And I highly recommend you to read this\nKyoto travel guidebook\n.\nKyoto Spring Itinerary  Day 1\nKyoto Botanical Gardens weeping cherry trees. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nPlaces of Interest:\nKyoto Botanical Garden, Kyoto Imperial Palace, Ginkakuji Temple, Philosophers Path, Heian Shrine (optional), Keage Incline,\nand\nOkazaki Canal\n.\nDuring hanami, it is always great to start the day with a trip either to\nKyoto Botanical Garden or Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyto Gosho)\n. Decide yourself which one you would visit first.\nKyoto botanical garden is arguably famous for viewing hundreds of Somei Yoshino & weeping cherry (a popular sakura variety in Japan), and picnicking. Besides, you can experience stunning tulip flowerbed there.\nA weeping cherry tree at Kyoto Imperial Palace garden. Photo Credit: mrhayata at Flickr.\nKyoto Imperial Palace\n, one of the famous historic attractions in Kyoto has a beautiful park called\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n. In fact, the Palace is surrounded by this decent and specious park.\nMany tourists and locals alike visit the park in the spring with an intention of seeing early-blooming\nShidarezakura\n(weeping cherry trees). You can find them in a small grove located in the northwest corner of the park.\nYou can gladly spend one and half an hour there. Its up to you though.\nGinkakujis Silver Pavilion. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nTake a taxi and head to\nGinkakuji\n a\nZen temple\n(a designated national treasure), built by shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa in 1482.\nI will be honest with you that it can be visited all year round, and every day it welcomes hundreds of tourists. Explore Silver Pavilion, the Hondo, Togudo, Sand garden and Moss garden.\nThe Philosophers Path and glorious cherry blossom along the canal. Photo Credit: fortherock at Flickr.\nYour next destination would be the\nPhilosophers Path\n(Tetsugaku no michi). It is one of my favorite cherry blossom viewing spot in Kyoto. It is extremely enjoying when you take a stroll along the path that follows a canal which is lined by hundreds of sakura trees.\nAlong the way you would discover many small bridges, use them to take awesome photographs of cherry blossoms. Also cafes and restaurants can easily be found along the walkway, so have your lunch there!\nThe Okazaki canal looks pretty in spring. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nIf you want to experience something unique out of your trip, take a trip to\nHeian Shrine\n. You will find a garden there with many weeping cherry trees.\nWhether you visit it or not, make sure you a pleasant boat ride in the\nOkazaki canal\n. Before you boarding the sightseeing boat, you should get to\nKeage Incline\n. I wont tell about this hanami spot, leave it alone, just go there and explore something incredible!\nThe boat departs every 15 minutes from the Nanzenji Boat Pier and return via Ebisugawa Dam to the pier. It is approximately 25 minutes ride, which is a 3 kilometer round trip cruise. Hours: 8:00  20:30, Date of operation: March 25  April 09, 2017, Fare: 1,200 JPY.\nI am sure you can cover all these attractions within a day trip!\nKyoto Spring Itinerary  Day 2\nThe famous wooden stage of the Kiyomizudera. Photo Credit: Wei-Te Wong at Flickr.\nPlaces of Interest:\nKiyomizudera Temple, Higashiyama District, Kodaiji Temple, and Maruyama Park,\nand\nKamogawa River\n.\nToday you are going to explore one of Kyotos best historic districts called the\nHigashiyama District\nwith other sightseeing attractions located nearby.\nWalking in is like stepping back in time as it is a famous place to experience traditional old Kyoto. The neighborhood has an abundance of important heritage such as old fashioned buildings, streets, and merchants shops.\nThe rock garden at Kodaiji temple. Photo Credit: zynke at Flickr.\nIt is always positive to start your trip at\nKiyomizudera\n(a Buddhist temple part of\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nand famous for its wooden stage). The early you visit it the better it would be because it is awfully a crowded place.\nBeing one of the most visited places in Kyoto, many tourists tend to see this wonder and its surroundings natural beauty, especially in spring and autumn.\nHave you ever seen any Japanese rock garden before? If you have not then I strongly recommended you to pay a visit to\nKodaiji temple\n, it is worth a visit!\nGion street and old houses. Photo Credit: Wikimedia commons.\nGet ready to take a walk to Kyotos most famous\nGeisha district\nknown as Gion. Often I receive emails from Japan enthusiast asking me where can I meet/see real geiko or maiko in Japan?\nThis is the ideal place to see them, no ",

Heres the Best Way to Spend Them.\n6 March 2025\n25 November 2023\nAbout\nLatest Posts\nHelen Foster\nHelen Foster is a Sydney-based author, journalist and content creator. She has traveled to Japan six times and is planning trip seven. Her articles on Japan have appeared in publications including Reader's Digest (Asia Pacific), RAC Horizons, Jetstar Magazine, the Japan National Tourism Organisation website and more. She is a digital publisher member of the Australian Society of Travel Writers.\nLatest posts by Helen Foster\n(\nsee all\n)\nShould You Tip in Japan?\n- 6 February 2026\nDiscover Miyajima Island: The Perfect One Day Itinerary\n- 1 February 2026\nDoes Tokyo Disney Have Single Rider Lines?\n- 29 January 2026\nWe think four full days is the minimum time you need to see all of Kyotos best sights without rushing around too much  so how should you break that down? Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy.\nQuick Summary\nHeres how to break down four days in Kyoto\nDay One  Arashiyama\n: Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park\nDay Two  Higashiyama\n: Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda\nDay Three  Fushimi Inari and Gion:\nFushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine\nDay Four  Temples and Tea\n: Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho\nThis covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city  but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading.\nArticle by\nHelen Foster.\nDisclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our\nAffiliate Disclosure.\nThis plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights.\nTable of Contents\n[Open]\n[Close]\nDay One  Arashiyama\nDay Two  Higashiyama\nDay Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion\nDay Four: Temples and Tea\nAre You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season?\nDay One  Arashiyama\nStart your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan.\nStart at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\nAs I explained in my post on\nhow long to spend in Kyoto\n, one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds  and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first  ideally before 8 am.\nThe forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn  dont miss it.\nJaplanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji\nIf the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called\nOtagi Nenbutsu Ji.\nThis is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto.\nOtagi-Nenbutsu Ji\nis a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people  and every single one\nis different. Some are serious, but there are also statues with tennis rackets; one looks like its carrying a puppy, and theres even one carrying a teddy bear if you look hard enough; they have different facial expressions and hand positions, and every time I visit, I spot something new. Its wonderful. Do not miss it.\nOnce youve finished admiring the statues, walk south on the small road outside the temple.\nOptional Stop: Adashino Nenbutsuji\nAfter about 8 minutes of walking, youll reach a set of steps on your right. There is no sign, and youll just see a small gravel area, some bike parking, and a railing.\nThese steps lead you up to\nAdashino Nenbutsuji Temple\n. This temple contains 8000 carved statues that are dedicated to people who died without any relatives, and it is the burial place of over 1000 bodies. For this reason, they ask that you dont take any pictures once inside the memorial area.\nIts also for that reason that I dont really want to tell you the other thing thats hidden in Adashino Nenbutsuji, but if I dont, and you read about this on another blog, youre going to think I dont know what Im talking about, so here goes.\nTheres a bamboo forest in Adashino Nenbutsuji thats much quieter than the one in Arashiyama.\nIf you visit, though, remember that\nAdashino Nenbutsuji\nis a spiritual place dedicated to the souls of people who died alone. So, see the bamboo; take a picture  but to respect the temples history, keep any full-on Instagram photo shoots for the other forest.\nIf you miss the steps to the temple, dont worry; theres another more obvious entrance a bit further down on the right. You also use this set of steps to head out of the shrine.\nKeep Your Eyes Peeled\nNow, keep going South, heading toward the point marked Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street on the map. Keep your eye out for a display case on your right-hand side  it contains a mini scene of tiny egg people  the eggs are silk cocoons, and the shop\nAdashino Mayumura\nnearby sells the figures.\nYou can see more about their designs, check opening hours, and find the location of their other store on the main street of Arashiyama on the\nMayumura website\n.\nThere is also a most beautiful house down this street  the garden is stunning. Unfortunately, they now have signs outside asking you not to take photographs but to keep an eye out for it.\nOptional Stop: Gio-ji\nThere are two moss temples in Kyoto  one of them,\nSaiho ji\nrequires booking in advance, but the one close to where you are right now,\nGioji\nis open to anyone.\nThe mossy carpet is beautiful year-round, but this is also a popular spot to see cherry blossoms and autumn leaves.\nSee more about opening hours and other details of\nGioji temple\n.\nIf youre not in a rush, you can visit many of the smaller shrines and temples scattered around this area for another hour or two.\nLunch Stop\nIf youre hungry, there are a few restaurants in this area. I picked\nTsure Zure\n, which has affordable soba dishes. It opens at 11am, if you feel like an early lunch.\nOptional Stop: The Hair Shrine\nFollow the road south and pass a small, unobtrusive shrine called\nMikami-jinja\n. Its slightly dilapidated appearance is ironic as its a beauty shrine  people go there to pray for good hair!\nThis has probably taken up most of the morning, so when it comes to the afternoon, you have a couple of options on where to go next  trains, shops, or monkeys! Youre unlikely to get all three of these done  but you can probably fit in two of them.\nThe Train Option\nClose to this point is Torokko Arashiyama Station  where you can board the\nSagano Romantic Train.\nThis gives your feet a rest while you travel past a pretty gorge  in Autumn, the blue of the gorge and the red and yellow leaves make for a stunning scene.\nThe train becomes a\nKyoto Must-See\nthis time of year, and you\nmust book train seats well in advance\n.\nTry to snag seats on the right-hand side of the train going out, which have better views.\nSee more tips in our\nguide to going on the Sagano Romantic Train\n.\nIt doesnt always get as booked out",

Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nPlaces of Interest:\nKyoto Botanical Garden, Kyoto Imperial Palace, Ginkakuji Temple, Philosophers Path, Heian Shrine (optional), Keage Incline,\nand\nOkazaki Canal\n.\nDuring hanami, it is always great to start the day with a trip either to\nKyoto Botanical Garden or Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyto Gosho)\n. Decide yourself which one you would visit first.\nKyoto botanical garden is arguably famous for viewing hundreds of Somei Yoshino & weeping cherry (a popular sakura variety in Japan), and picnicking. Besides, you can experience stunning tulip flowerbed there.\nA weeping cherry tree at Kyoto Imperial Palace garden.

In fact, the Palace is surrounded by this decent and specious park.\nMany tourists and locals alike visit the park in the spring with an intention of seeing early-blooming\nShidarezakura\n(weeping cherry trees). You can find them in a small grove located in the northwest corner of the park.\nYou can gladly spend one and half an hour there. Its up to you though.\nGinkakujis Silver Pavilion. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nTake a taxi and head to\nGinkakuji\n a\nZen temple\n(a designated national treasure), built by shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa in 1482.\nI will be honest with you that it can be visited all year round, and every day it welcomes hundreds of tourists. Explore Silver Pavilion, the Hondo, Togudo, Sand garden and Moss garden.\nThe Philosophers Path and glorious cherry blossom along the canal. Photo Credit: fortherock at Flickr.\nYour next destination would be the\nPhilosophers Path\n(Tetsugaku no michi). It is one of my favorite cherry blossom viewing spot in Kyoto. It is extremely enjoying when you take a stroll along the path that follows a canal which is lined by hundreds of sakura trees.\nAlong the way you would discover many small bridges, use them to take awesome photographs of cherry blossoms. Also cafes and restaurants can easily be found along the walkway, so have your lunch there!\nThe Okazaki canal looks pretty in spring. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nIf you want to experience something unique out of your trip, take a trip to\nHeian Shrine\n. You will find a garden there with many weeping cherry trees.\nWhether you visit it or not, make sure you a pleasant boat ride in the\nOkazaki canal\n. Before you boarding the sightseeing boat, you should get to\nKeage Incline\n. I wont tell about this hanami spot, leave it alone, just go there and explore something incredible!\nThe boat departs every 15 minutes from the Nanzenji Boat Pier and return via Ebisugawa Dam to the pier. It is approximately 25 minutes ride, which is a 3 kilometer round trip cruise. Hours: 8:00  20:30, Date of operation: March 25  April 09, 2017, Fare: 1,200 JPY.\nI am sure you can cover all these attractions within a day trip!\nKyoto Spring Itinerary  Day 2\nThe famous wooden stage of the Kiyomizudera.

The neighborhood has an abundance of important heritage such as old fashioned buildings, streets, and merchants shops.\nThe rock garden at Kodaiji temple. Photo Credit: zynke at Flickr.\nIt is always positive to start your trip at\nKiyomizudera\n(a Buddhist temple part of\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nand famous for its wooden stage). The early you visit it the better it would be because it is awfully a crowded place.\nBeing one of the most visited places in Kyoto, many tourists tend to see this wonder and its surroundings natural beauty, especially in spring and autumn.\nHave you ever seen any Japanese rock garden before? If you have not then I strongly recommended you to pay a visit to\nKodaiji temple\n, it is worth a visit!\nGion street and old houses.

Heres the Best Way to Spend Them.\n6 March 2025\n25 November 2023\nAbout\nLatest Posts\nHelen Foster\nHelen Foster is a Sydney-based author, journalist and content creator. She has traveled to Japan six times and is planning trip seven. Her articles on Japan have appeared in publications including Reader's Digest (Asia Pacific), RAC Horizons, Jetstar Magazine, the Japan National Tourism Organisation website and more.

Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy.\nQuick Summary\nHeres how to break down four days in Kyoto\nDay One  Arashiyama\n: Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park\nDay Two  Higashiyama\n: Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda\nDay Three  Fushimi Inari and Gion:\nFushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine\nDay Four  Temples and Tea\n: Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho\nThis covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city  but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading.\nArticle by\nHelen Foster.\nDisclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our\nAffiliate Disclosure.\nThis plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights.\nTable of Contents\n[Open]\n[Close]\nDay One  Arashiyama\nDay Two  Higashiyama\nDay Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion\nDay Four: Temples and Tea\nAre You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season?\nDay One  Arashiyama\nStart your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan.\nStart at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\nAs I explained in my post on\nhow long to spend in Kyoto\n, one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds  and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first  ideally before 8 am.\nThe forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn  dont miss it.\nJaplanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji\nIf the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called\nOtagi Nenbutsu Ji.\nThis is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto.\nOtagi-Nenbutsu Ji\nis a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people  and every single one\nis different. Some are serious, but there are also statues with tennis rackets; one looks like its carrying a puppy, and theres even one carrying a teddy bear if you look hard enough; they have different facial expressions and hand positions, and every time I visit, I spot something new. Its wonderful. Do not miss it.\nOnce youve finished admiring the statues, walk south on the small road outside the temple.\nOptional Stop: Adashino Nenbutsuji\nAfter about 8 minutes of walking, youll reach a set of steps on your right. There is no sign, and youll just see a small gravel area, some bike parking, and a railing.\nThese steps lead you up to\nAdashino Nenbutsuji Temple\n. This temple contains 8000 carved statues that are dedicated to people who died without any relatives, and it is the burial place of over 1000 bodies. For this reason, they ask that you dont take any pictures once inside the memorial area.\nIts also for that reason that I dont really want to tell you the other thing thats hidden in Adashino Nenbutsuji, but if I dont, and you read about this on another blog, youre going to think I dont know what Im talking about, so here goes.\nTheres a bamboo forest in Adashino Nenbutsuji thats much quieter than the one in Arashiyama.\nIf you visit, though, remember that\nAdashino Nenbutsuji\nis a spiritual place dedicated to the souls of people who died alone. So, see the bamboo; take a picture  but to respect the temples history, keep any full-on Instagram photo shoots for the other forest.\nIf you miss the steps to the temple, dont worry; theres another more obvious entrance a bit further down on the right. You also use this set of steps to head out of the shrine.\nKeep Your Eyes Peeled\nNow, keep going South, heading toward the point marked Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street on the map. Keep your eye out for a display case on your right-hand side  it contains a mini scene of tiny egg people  the eggs are silk cocoons, and the shop\nAdashino Mayumura\nnearby sells the figures.\nYou can see more about their designs, check opening hours, and find the location of their other store on the main street of Arashiyama on the\nMayumura website\n.\nThere is also a most beautiful house down this street  the garden is stunning. Unfortunately, they now have signs outside asking you not to take photographs but to keep an eye out for it.\nOptional Stop: Gio-ji\nThere are two moss temples in Kyoto  one of them,\nSaiho ji\nrequires booking in advance, but the one close to where you are right now,\nGioji\nis open to anyone.\nThe mossy carpet is beautiful year-round, but this is also a popular spot to see cherry blossoms and autumn leaves.\nSee more about opening hours and other details of\nGioji temple\n.\nIf youre not in a rush, you can visit many of the smaller shrines and temples scattered around this area for another hour or two.\nLunch Stop\nIf youre hungry, there are a few restaurants in this area. I picked\nTsure Zure\n, which has affordable soba dishes. It opens at 11am, if you feel like an early lunch.\nOptional Stop: The Hair Shrine\nFollow the road south and pass a small, unobtrusive shrine called\nMikami-jinja\n. Its slightly dilapidated appearance is ironic as its a beauty shrine  people go there to pray for good hair!\nThis has probably taken up most of the morning, so when it comes to the afternoon, you have a couple of options on where to go next  trains, shops, or monkeys! Youre unlikely to get all three of these done  but you can probably fit in two of them.\nThe Train Option\nClose to this point is Torokko Arashiyama Station  where you can board the\nSagano Romantic Train.\nThis gives your feet a rest while you travel past a pretty gorge  in Autumn, the blue of the gorge and the red and yellow leaves make for a stunning scene.\nThe train becomes a\nKyoto Must-See\nthis time of year, and you\nmust book train seats well in advance\n.\nTry to snag seats on the right-hand side of the train going out, which have better views.\nSee more tips in our\nguide to going on the Sagano Romantic Train\n.\nIt doesnt always get as booked out",

Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nPlaces of Interest:\nKyoto Botanical Garden, Kyoto Imperial Palace, Ginkakuji Temple, Philosophers Path, Heian Shrine (optional), Keage Incline,\nand\nOkazaki Canal\n.\nDuring hanami, it is always great to start the day with a trip either to\nKyoto Botanical Garden or Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyto Gosho)\n. Decide yourself which one you would visit first.\nKyoto botanical garden is arguably famous for viewing hundreds of Somei Yoshino & weeping cherry (a popular sakura variety in Japan), and picnicking. Besides, you can experience stunning tulip flowerbed there.\nA weeping cherry tree at Kyoto Imperial Palace garden.

In fact, the Palace is surrounded by this decent and specious park.\nMany tourists and locals alike visit the park in the spring with an intention of seeing early-blooming\nShidarezakura\n(weeping cherry trees). You can find them in a small grove located in the northwest corner of the park.\nYou can gladly spend one and half an hour there. Its up to you though.\nGinkakujis Silver Pavilion. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nTake a taxi and head to\nGinkakuji\n a\nZen temple\n(a designated national treasure), built by shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa in 1482.\nI will be honest with you that it can be visited all year round, and every day it welcomes hundreds of tourists. Explore Silver Pavilion, the Hondo, Togudo, Sand garden and Moss garden.\nThe Philosophers Path and glorious cherry blossom along the canal. Photo Credit: fortherock at Flickr.\nYour next destination would be the\nPhilosophers Path\n(Tetsugaku no michi). It is one of my favorite cherry blossom viewing spot in Kyoto. It is extremely enjoying when you take a stroll along the path that follows a canal which is lined by hundreds of sakura trees.\nAlong the way you would discover many small bridges, use them to take awesome photographs of cherry blossoms. Also cafes and restaurants can easily be found along the walkway, so have your lunch there!\nThe Okazaki canal looks pretty in spring. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nIf you want to experience something unique out of your trip, take a trip to\nHeian Shrine\n. You will find a garden there with many weeping cherry trees.\nWhether you visit it or not, make sure you a pleasant boat ride in the\nOkazaki canal\n. Before you boarding the sightseeing boat, you should get to\nKeage Incline\n. I wont tell about this hanami spot, leave it alone, just go there and explore something incredible!\nThe boat departs every 15 minutes from the Nanzenji Boat Pier and return via Ebisugawa Dam to the pier. It is approximately 25 minutes ride, which is a 3 kilometer round trip cruise. Hours: 8:00  20:30, Date of operation: March 25  April 09, 2017, Fare: 1,200 JPY.\nI am sure you can cover all these attractions within a day trip!\nKyoto Spring Itinerary  Day 2\nThe famous wooden stage of the Kiyomizudera.

The neighborhood has an abundance of important heritage such as old fashioned buildings, streets, and merchants shops.\nThe rock garden at Kodaiji temple. Photo Credit: zynke at Flickr.\nIt is always positive to start your trip at\nKiyomizudera\n(a Buddhist temple part of\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nand famous for its wooden stage). The early you visit it the better it would be because it is awfully a crowded place.\nBeing one of the most visited places in Kyoto, many tourists tend to see this wonder and its surroundings natural beauty, especially in spring and autumn.\nHave you ever seen any Japanese rock garden before? If you have not then I strongly recommended you to pay a visit to\nKodaiji temple\n, it is worth a visit!\nGion street and old houses.

Heres the Best Way to Spend Them.\n6 March 2025\n25 November 2023\nAbout\nLatest Posts\nHelen Foster\nHelen Foster is a Sydney-based author, journalist and content creator. She has traveled to Japan six times and is planning trip seven. Her articles on Japan have appeared in publications including Reader's Digest (Asia Pacific), RAC Horizons, Jetstar Magazine, the Japan National Tourism Organisation website and more. She is a digital publisher member of the Australian Society of Travel Writers.\nLatest posts by Helen Foster\n(\nsee all\n)\nShould You Tip in Japan?\n- 6 February 2026\nDiscover Miyajima Island: The Perfect One Day Itinerary\n- 1 February 2026\nDoes Tokyo Disney Have Single Rider Lines?\n- 29 January 2026\nWe think four full days is the minimum time you need to see all of Kyotos best sights without rushing around too much  so how should you break that down? Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy.\nQuick Summary\nHeres how to break down four days in Kyoto\nDay One  Arashiyama\n: Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park\nDay Two  Higashiyama\n: Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda\nDay Three  Fushimi Inari and Gion:\nFushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine\nDay Four  Temples and Tea\n: Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho\nThis covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city  but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading.\nArticle by\nHelen Foster.\nDisclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our\nAffiliate Disclosure.\nThis plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights.\nTable of Contents\n[Open]\n[Close]\nDay One  Arashiyama\nDay Two  Higashiyama\nDay Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion\nDay Four: Temples and Tea\nAre You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season?\nDay One  Arashiyama\nStart your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan.\nStart at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\nAs I explained in my post on\nhow long to spend in Kyoto\n, one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds  and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first  ideally before 8 am.\nThe forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn  dont miss it.\nJaplanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji\nIf the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called\nOtagi Nenbutsu Ji.\nThis is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto.\nOtagi-Nenbutsu Ji\nis a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people  and every single one\nis different. Some are serious, but there are also statues with tennis rackets; one looks like its carrying a puppy, and theres even one carrying a teddy bear if you look hard enough; they have different facial expressions and hand positions, and every time I visit, I spot something new. Its wonderful. Do not miss it.\nOnce youve finished admiring the statues, walk south on the small road outside the temple.\nOptional Stop: Adashino Nenbutsuji\nAfter about 8 minutes of walking, youll reach a set of steps on your right. There is no sign, and youll just see a small gravel area, some bike parking, and a railing.\nThese steps lead you up to\nAdashino Nenbutsuji Temple\n. This temple contains 8000 carved statues that are dedicated to people who died without any relatives, and it is the burial place of over 1000 bodies. For this reason, they ask that you dont take any pictures once inside the memorial area.\nIts also for that reason that I dont really want to tell you the other thing thats hidden in Adashino Nenbutsuji, but if I dont, and you read about this on another blog, youre going to think I dont know what Im talking about, so here goes.\nTheres a bamboo forest in Adashino Nenbutsuji thats much quieter than the one in Arashiyama.\nIf you visit, though, remember that\nAdashino Nenbutsuji\nis a spiritual place dedicated to the souls of people who died alone. So, see the bamboo; take a picture  but to respect the temples history, keep any full-on Instagram photo shoots for the other forest.\nIf you miss the steps to the temple, dont worry; theres another more obvious entrance a bit further down on the right. You also use this set of steps to head out of the shrine.\nKeep Your Eyes Peeled\nNow, keep going South, heading toward the point marked Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street on the map. Keep your eye out for a display case on your right-hand side  it contains a mini scene of tiny egg people  the eggs are silk cocoons, and the shop\nAdashino Mayumura\nnearby sells the figures.\nYou can see more about their designs, check opening hours, and find the location of their other store on the main street of Arashiyama on the\nMayumura website\n.\nThere is also a most beautiful house down this street  the garden is stunning. Unfortunately, they now have signs outside asking you not to take photographs but to keep an eye out for it.\nOptional Stop: Gio-ji\nThere are two moss temples in Kyoto  one of them,\nSaiho ji\nrequires booking in advance, but the one close to where you are right now,\nGioji\nis open to anyone.\nThe mossy carpet is beautiful year-round, but this is also a popular spot to see cherry blossoms and autumn leaves.\nSee more about opening hours and other details of\nGioji temple\n.\nIf youre not in a rush, you can visit many of the smaller shrines and temples scattered around this area for another hour or two.\nLunch Stop\nIf youre hungry, there are a few restaurants in this area. I picked\nTsure Zure\n, which has affordable soba dishes. It opens at 11am, if you feel like an early lunch.\nOptional Stop: The Hair Shrine\nFollow the road south and pass a small, unobtrusive shrine called\nMikami-jinja\n. Its slightly dilapidated appearance is ironic as its a beauty shrine  people go there to pray for good hair!\nThis has probably taken up most of the morning, so when it comes to the afternoon, you have a couple of options on where to go next  trains, shops, or monkeys! Youre unlikely to get all three of these done  but you can probably fit in two of them.\nThe Train Option\nClose to this point is Torokko Arashiyama Station  where you can board the\nSagano Romantic Train.\nThis gives your feet a rest while you travel past a pretty gorge  in Autumn, the blue of the gorge and the red and yellow leaves make for a stunning scene.\nThe train becomes a\nKyoto Must-See\nthis time of year, and you\nmust book train seats well in advance\n.\nTry to snag seats on the right-hand side of the train going out, which have better views.\nSee more tips in our\nguide to going on the Sagano Romantic Train\n.\nIt doesnt always get as booked out",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds.\nCouple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto:\nUsa.Pin / Shutterstock.com\nIntroduction\nCherry blossom season (late March and early April)\nis a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees.\nCycling under the cherries in Kyoto:\nweniliou / Shutterstock.com\nFortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of\nSouthern Higashiyama\nduring the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between\nMaruyama-koen Park\nand\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\n. That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home).\nKiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season:\nSean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\nThe best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off.\nThe route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary.\nRomantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary\nDistance:\nAbout 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides\nTime required:\nAbout six hours (four in the day, two in the evening)\nSights:\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n,\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\n,\nShoren-in Temple\n,\nMaruyama-koen Park\n,\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nStarting point:\nImadegawa Station on the\nKarasuma Subway Line\nEnd Point:\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nKiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom:\nf11 photo / Shutterstock.com\nNote:\nRestaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to\nthe food floor of Daimaru\nor\nTakashimaya department stores\nand pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am.\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\nStart in the mid-morning. Take the\nKarasuma subway line\nto Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n(Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out.\nWeeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park:\nzzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com\nWalk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens\nAfter enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\n. If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many beautiful cherry trees en route. Walk east along Imadegawa-dori Street for about 700 meters until you reach the\nKamo-gawa River\n. At Demachiyanagi (where the Kamo-gawa and Katsura-gawa rivers meet), take a left and walk upstream along the Kamo-gawa (its the first river you come to). The river is lined on both sides with great cherry trees and you will surely see many hanami (flower viewing) parties in progress. After about two kilometers, you will come to the southern entrance to the Botanical Gardens above the east bank of the river. Climb the bank and follow the road that parallels the river to reach the entrance. If you choose to take the subway from the Imperial Palace Park, just return to Imadegawa Station and take it north three stops north to the Kitayama stop.\nCherries along the Kamo-gawa River:\nYUSHENG HSU / Shutterstock.com\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\nIf youve walked here, enter through the southern entrance. If youve taken the subway, youll enter through the north entrance. There are several cherry arbors here, mostly in the middle and north end of the gardens. You should be able to find a nice secluded tree to have all to yourselves.\nCherries in the Kyoto Botanical Gardens:\nweniliou / Shutterstock.com\nSubway Downtown to Hotel and Rest\nAfter a picnic lunch and a nap under a tree at the Botanical Gardens, make your way to Kitayama Station (at the north end of the gardens) and take the subway down to your hotel or ryokan to freshen up and take a rest. Eat dinner somewhere\ndowntown\n(you might want to reserve a place through your hotel or ryokan).\nKyoto subway interior:\nTupungato / Shutterstock.com\nSubway to Higashiyama Station\nAfter dinner, take\nthe Tozai subway line\nto Higashiyama Station. Walk along Sanjo-dori Street and take a right and walk up Jingu-michi Street.\nYoung lady on the Kyoto subway:\noneinchpunch / Shutterstock.com\nShoren-in Temple\nThe first major sight for this evening is\nShoren-in Temple\n, where a light up is held during cherry blossom season starting at 6.30pm. This temple isnt really a cherry blossom destination, but its very beautiful and the bamboo grove here is magical. Best of all, its not usually crowded.\nShoren-in Temple during evening light up:\nMyPixelDiaries / Shutterstock.com\nWalk from Shoren-in Maruyama-koen Park\nLeave Shoren-in, take a left and walk south along Jingu-michi. Youll soon see the incredible Gate of\nChion-in Temple\ntowering above you on your left. It will be illuminated in cherry blossom season. If youre interested, you can pay to enter, but we usually just like to admire it from street level. Just past Chion-in, youll come to the entrance to\nMaruyama-koen Park\n.\nChion-in Gate during cherry blossom season  image  Chris Rowthorn\nMaruyama-koen Park\nOkay, we said that youd avoid the crowds on this route, but theres no avoiding them here  and you shouldnt \nMaruyama-koen\nis the most\npopular place in Kyoto for nighttime hanami\n. The place is festive and fun. At the heart of the park is one large, famous cherry tree that looks like a frozen white explosion. Nearby you will see tables set up beneath cherry trees where you can order sake, beer and snacks.\nThe central cherry tree at Maruyama-koen in the evening:\nSean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\nWalk to Kiyomizu-dera Temple\nAfter enjoying the scene at\nMaruyama-koen Park\n, walk south (away from the central cherry tree), keeping the pond on your left and the Choraku-kan Hotel on your right. Its a slight uphill. Keep going straight for about 100 meters until you come to a T-junction. Turn right (downhill) and then take your first left. This attractive lane is called\nNene-no-Michi Lane\n. Youll pass several temples including Kodai-ji and Entoku-in. At the end of this section, youll go left (uphill) briefly and then take a right into\nNinen-zaka\n. Follow this, climb the steps and then work your way up\nSannen-zaka\n, which brings you out to the road that leads up to the entrance to\nKiyomizu-dera\n, which you will enter.\nNight view of the famous Maruyama Par",

The itinerary planning, coordination, and execution were handled efficiently, which made our trip largely stress-free. The arrangements and logistics were good, and the team was available throughout the trip for support whenever we needed assistance, which was reassuring in a foreign country like Japan. That said, the stay could have been a little better in terms of quality and room space, and keeping a backup plan (in terms of transport availability) would have further made our experience better.

Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nPlaces of Interest:\nKyoto Botanical Garden, Kyoto Imperial Palace, Ginkakuji Temple, Philosophers Path, Heian Shrine (optional), Keage Incline,\nand\nOkazaki Canal\n.\nDuring hanami, it is always great to start the day with a trip either to\nKyoto Botanical Garden or Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyto Gosho)\n. Decide yourself which one you would visit first.\nKyoto botanical garden is arguably famous for viewing hundreds of Somei Yoshino & weeping cherry (a popular sakura variety in Japan), and picnicking. Besides, you can experience stunning tulip flowerbed there.\nA weeping cherry tree at Kyoto Imperial Palace garden.

In fact, the Palace is surrounded by this decent and specious park.\nMany tourists and locals alike visit the park in the spring with an intention of seeing early-blooming\nShidarezakura\n(weeping cherry trees). You can find them in a small grove located in the northwest corner of the park.\nYou can gladly spend one and half an hour there. Its up to you though.\nGinkakujis Silver Pavilion.

Explore Silver Pavilion, the Hondo, Togudo, Sand garden and Moss garden.\nThe Philosophers Path and glorious cherry blossom along the canal. Photo Credit: fortherock at Flickr.\nYour next destination would be the\nPhilosophers Path\n(Tetsugaku no michi). It is one of my favorite cherry blossom viewing spot in Kyoto. It is extremely enjoying when you take a stroll along the path that follows a canal which is lined by hundreds of sakura trees.\nAlong the way you would discover many small bridges, use them to take awesome photographs of cherry blossoms. Also cafes and restaurants can easily be found along the walkway, so have your lunch there!\nThe Okazaki canal looks pretty in spring. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nIf you want to experience something unique out of your trip, take a trip to\nHeian Shrine\n. You will find a garden there with many weeping cherry trees.\nWhether you visit it or not, make sure you a pleasant boat ride in the\nOkazaki canal\n. Before you boarding the sightseeing boat, you should get to\nKeage Incline\n. I wont tell about this hanami spot, leave it alone, just go there and explore something incredible!\nThe boat departs every 15 minutes from the Nanzenji Boat Pier and return via Ebisugawa Dam to the pier. It is approximately 25 minutes ride, which is a 3 kilometer round trip cruise. Hours: 8:00  20:30, Date of operation: March 25  April 09, 2017, Fare: 1,200 JPY.\nI am sure you can cover all these attractions within a day trip!\nKyoto Spring Itinerary  Day 2\nThe famous wooden stage of the Kiyomizudera.

The neighborhood has an abundance of important heritage such as old fashioned buildings, streets, and merchants shops.\nThe rock garden at Kodaiji temple. Photo Credit: zynke at Flickr.\nIt is always positive to start your trip at\nKiyomizudera\n(a Buddhist temple part of\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nand famous for its wooden stage). The early you visit it the better it would be because it is awfully a crowded place.\nBeing one of the most visited places in Kyoto, many tourists tend to see this wonder and its surroundings natural beauty, especially in spring and autumn.\nHave you ever seen any Japanese rock garden before? If you have not then I strongly recommended you to pay a visit to\nKodaiji temple\n, it is worth a visit!\nGion street and old houses. Photo Credit: Wikimedia commons.\nGet ready to take a walk to Kyotos most famous\nGeisha district\nknown as Gion. Often I receive emails from Japan enthusiast asking me where can I meet/see real geiko or maiko in Japan?\nThis is the ideal place to see them, no ",

She has traveled to Japan six times and is planning trip seven. Her articles on Japan have appeared in publications including Reader's Digest (Asia Pacific), RAC Horizons, Jetstar Magazine, the Japan National Tourism Organisation website and more. She is a digital publisher member of the Australian Society of Travel Writers.\nLatest posts by Helen Foster\n(\nsee all\n)\nShould You Tip in Japan?\n- 6 February 2026\nDiscover Miyajima Island: The Perfect One Day Itinerary\n- 1 February 2026\nDoes Tokyo Disney Have Single Rider Lines?\n- 29 January 2026\nWe think four full days is the minimum time you need to see all of Kyotos best sights without rushing around too much  so how should you break that down? Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy.\nQuick Summary\nHeres how to break down four days in Kyoto\nDay One  Arashiyama\n: Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park\nDay Two  Higashiyama\n: Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda\nDay Three  Fushimi Inari and Gion:\nFushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine\nDay Four  Temples and Tea\n: Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho\nThis covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city  but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading.\nArticle by\nHelen Foster.\nDisclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our\nAffiliate Disclosure.\nThis plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights.\nTable of Contents\n[Open]\n[Close]\nDay One  Arashiyama\nDay Two  Higashiyama\nDay Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion\nDay Four: Temples and Tea\nAre You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season?\nDay One  Arashiyama\nStart your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan.\nStart at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\nAs I explained in my post on\nhow long to spend in Kyoto\n, one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds  and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first  ideally before 8 am.\nThe forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn  dont miss it.\nJaplanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji\nIf the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called\nOtagi Nenbutsu Ji.\nThis is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto.\nOtagi-Nenbutsu Ji\nis a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people  and every single one\nis different. Some are serious, but there are also statues with tennis rackets; one looks like its carrying a puppy, and theres even one carrying a teddy bear if you look hard enough; they have different facial expressions and hand positions, and every time I visit, I spot something new. Its wonderful. Do not miss it.\nOnce youve finished admiring the statues, walk south on the small road outside the temple.\nOptional Stop: Adashino Nenbutsuji\nAfter about 8 minutes of walking, youll reach a set of steps on your right. There is no sign, and youll just see a small gravel area, some bike parking, and a railing.\nThese steps lead you up to\nAdashino Nenbutsuji Temple\n. This temple contains 8000 carved statues that are dedicated to people who died without any relatives, and it is the burial place of over 1000 bodies. For this reason, they ask that you dont take any pictures once inside the memorial area.\nIts also for that reason that I dont really want to tell you the other thing thats hidden in Adashino Nenbutsuji, but if I dont, and you read about this on another blog, youre going to think I dont know what Im talking about, so here goes.\nTheres a bamboo forest in Adashino Nenbutsuji thats much quieter than the one in Arashiyama.\nIf you visit, though, remember that\nAdashino Nenbutsuji\nis a spiritual place dedicated to the souls of people who died alone. So, see the bamboo; take a picture  but to respect the temples history, keep any full-on Instagram photo shoots for the other forest.\nIf you miss the steps to the temple, dont worry; theres another more obvious entrance a bit further down on the right. You also use this set of steps to head out of the shrine.\nKeep Your Eyes Peeled\nNow, keep going South, heading toward the point marked Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street on the map. Keep your eye out for a display case on your right-hand side  it contains a mini scene of tiny egg people  the eggs are silk cocoons, and the shop\nAdashino Mayumura\nnearby sells the figures.\nYou can see more about their designs, check opening hours, and find the location of their other store on the main street of Arashiyama on the\nMayumura website\n.\nThere is also a most beautiful house down this street  the garden is stunning. Unfortunately, they now have signs outside asking you not to take photographs but to keep an eye out for it.\nOptional Stop: Gio-ji\nThere are two moss temples in Kyoto  one of them,\nSaiho ji\nrequires booking in advance, but the one close to where you are right now,\nGioji\nis open to anyone.\nThe mossy carpet is beautiful year-round, but this is also a popular spot to see cherry blossoms and autumn leaves.\nSee more about opening hours and other details of\nGioji temple\n.\nIf youre not in a rush, you can visit many of the smaller shrines and temples scattered around this area for another hour or two.\nLunch Stop\nIf youre hungry, there are a few restaurants in this area. I picked\nTsure Zure\n, which has affordable soba dishes. It opens at 11am, if you feel like an early lunch.\nOptional Stop: The Hair Shrine\nFollow the road south and pass a small, unobtrusive shrine called\nMikami-jinja\n. Its slightly dilapidated appearance is ironic as its a beauty shrine  people go there to pray for good hair!\nThis has probably taken up most of the morning, so when it comes to the afternoon, you have a couple of options on where to go next  trains, shops, or monkeys! Youre unlikely to get all three of these done  but you can probably fit in two of them.\nThe Train Option\nClose to this point is Torokko Arashiyama Station  where you can board the\nSagano Romantic Train.\nThis gives your feet a rest while you travel past a pretty gorge  in Autumn, the blue of the gorge and the red and yellow leaves make for a stunning scene.\nThe train becomes a\nKyoto Must-See\nthis time of year, and you\nmust book train seats well in advance\n.\nTry to snag seats on the right-hand side of the train going out, which have better views.\nSee more tips in our\nguide to going on the Sagano Romantic Train\n.\nIt doesnt always get as booked out",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds.\nCouple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto:\nUsa.Pin / Shutterstock.com\nIntroduction\nCherry blossom season (late March and early April)\nis a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees.\nCycling under the cherries in Kyoto:\nweniliou / Shutterstock.com\nFortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of\nSouthern Higashiyama\nduring the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between\nMaruyama-koen Park\nand\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\n. That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home).\nKiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season:\nSean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\nThe best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off.\nThe route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary.\nRomantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary\nDistance:\nAbout 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides\nTime required:\nAbout six hours (four in the day, two in the evening)\nSights:\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n,\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\n,\nShoren-in Temple\n,\nMaruyama-koen Park\n,\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nStarting point:\nImadegawa Station on the\nKarasuma Subway Line\nEnd Point:\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nKiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom:\nf11 photo / Shutterstock.com\nNote:\nRestaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to\nthe food floor of Daimaru\nor\nTakashimaya department stores\nand pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am.\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\nStart in the mid-morning. Take the\nKarasuma subway line\nto Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n(Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out.\nWeeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park:\nzzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com\nWalk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens\nAfter enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\n. If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many beautiful cherry trees en route. Walk east along Imadegawa-dori Street for about 700 meters until you reach the\nKamo-gawa River\n. At Demachiyanagi (where the Kamo-gawa and Katsura-gawa rivers meet), take a left and walk upstream along the Kamo-gawa (its the first river you come to). The river is lined on both sides with great cherry trees and you will surely see many hanami (flower viewing) parties in progress. After about two kilometers, you will come to the southern entrance to the Botanical Gardens above the east bank of the river. Climb the bank and follow the road that parallels the river to reach the entrance. If you choose to take the subway from the Imperial Palace Park, just return to Imadegawa Station and take it north three stops north to the Kitayama stop.\nCherries along the Kamo-gawa River:\nYUSHENG HSU / Shutterstock.com\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\nIf youve walked here, enter through the southern entrance. If youve taken the subway, youll enter through the north entrance. There are several cherry arbors here, mostly in the middle and north end of the gardens. You should be able to find a nice secluded tree to have all to yourselves.\nCherries in the Kyoto Botanical Gardens:\nweniliou / Shutterstock.com\nSubway Downtown to Hotel and Rest\nAfter a picnic lunch and a nap under a tree at the Botanical Gardens, make your way to Kitayama Station (at the north end of the gardens) and take the subway down to your hotel or ryokan to freshen up and take a rest. Eat dinner somewhere\ndowntown\n(you might want to reserve a place through your hotel or ryokan).\nKyoto subway interior:\nTupungato / Shutterstock.com\nSubway to Higashiyama Station\nAfter dinner, take\nthe Tozai subway line\nto Higashiyama Station. Walk along Sanjo-dori Street and take a right and walk up Jingu-michi Street.\nYoung lady on the Kyoto subway:\noneinchpunch / Shutterstock.com\nShoren-in Temple\nThe first major sight for this evening is\nShoren-in Temple\n, where a light up is held during cherry blossom season starting at 6.30pm. This temple isnt really a cherry blossom destination, but its very beautiful and the bamboo grove here is magical. Best of all, its not usually crowded.\nShoren-in Temple during evening light up:\nMyPixelDiaries / Shutterstock.com\nWalk from Shoren-in Maruyama-koen Park\nLeave Shoren-in, take a left and walk south along Jingu-michi. Youll soon see the incredible Gate of\nChion-in Temple\ntowering above you on your left. It will be illuminated in cherry blossom season. If youre interested, you can pay to enter, but we usually just like to admire it from street level. Just past Chion-in, youll come to the entrance to\nMaruyama-koen Park\n.\nChion-in Gate during cherry blossom season  image  Chris Rowthorn\nMaruyama-koen Park\nOkay, we said that youd avoid the crowds on this route, but theres no avoiding them here  and you shouldnt \nMaruyama-koen\nis the most\npopular place in Kyoto for nighttime hanami\n. The place is festive and fun. At the heart of the park is one large, famous cherry tree that looks like a frozen white explosion. Nearby you will see tables set up beneath cherry trees where you can order sake, beer and snacks.\nThe central cherry tree at Maruyama-koen in the evening:\nSean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\nWalk to Kiyomizu-dera Temple\nAfter enjoying the scene at\nMaruyama-koen Park\n, walk south (away from the central cherry tree), keeping the pond on your left and the Choraku-kan Hotel on your right. Its a slight uphill. Keep going straight for about 100 meters until you come to a T-junction. Turn right (downhill) and then take your first left. This attractive lane is called\nNene-no-Michi Lane\n. Youll pass several temples including Kodai-ji and Entoku-in. At the end of this section, youll go left (uphill) briefly and then take a right into\nNinen-zaka\n. Follow this, climb the steps and then work your way up\nSannen-zaka\n, which brings you out to the road that leads up to the entrance to\nKiyomizu-dera\n, which you will enter.\nNight view of the famous Maruyama Par",

The itinerary planning, coordination, and execution were handled efficiently, which made our trip largely stress-free. The arrangements and logistics were good, and the team was available throughout the trip for support whenever we needed assistance, which was reassuring in a foreign country like Japan. That said, the stay could have been a little better in terms of quality and room space, and keeping a backup plan (in terms of transport availability) would have further made our experience better.

Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nPlaces of Interest:\nKyoto Botanical Garden, Kyoto Imperial Palace, Ginkakuji Temple, Philosophers Path, Heian Shrine (optional), Keage Incline,\nand\nOkazaki Canal\n.\nDuring hanami, it is always great to start the day with a trip either to\nKyoto Botanical Garden or Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyto Gosho)\n. Decide yourself which one you would visit first.\nKyoto botanical garden is arguably famous for viewing hundreds of Somei Yoshino & weeping cherry (a popular sakura variety in Japan), and picnicking. Besides, you can experience stunning tulip flowerbed there.\nA weeping cherry tree at Kyoto Imperial Palace garden.

In fact, the Palace is surrounded by this decent and specious park.\nMany tourists and locals alike visit the park in the spring with an intention of seeing early-blooming\nShidarezakura\n(weeping cherry trees). You can find them in a small grove located in the northwest corner of the park.\nYou can gladly spend one and half an hour there. Its up to you though.\nGinkakujis Silver Pavilion.

Explore Silver Pavilion, the Hondo, Togudo, Sand garden and Moss garden.\nThe Philosophers Path and glorious cherry blossom along the canal. Photo Credit: fortherock at Flickr.\nYour next destination would be the\nPhilosophers Path\n(Tetsugaku no michi). It is one of my favorite cherry blossom viewing spot in Kyoto. It is extremely enjoying when you take a stroll along the path that follows a canal which is lined by hundreds of sakura trees.\nAlong the way you would discover many small bridges, use them to take awesome photographs of cherry blossoms. Also cafes and restaurants can easily be found along the walkway, so have your lunch there!\nThe Okazaki canal looks pretty in spring. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nIf you want to experience something unique out of your trip, take a trip to\nHeian Shrine\n. You will find a garden there with many weeping cherry trees.\nWhether you visit it or not, make sure you a pleasant boat ride in the\nOkazaki canal\n. Before you boarding the sightseeing boat, you should get to\nKeage Incline\n. I wont tell about this hanami spot, leave it alone, just go there and explore something incredible!\nThe boat departs every 15 minutes from the Nanzenji Boat Pier and return via Ebisugawa Dam to the pier. It is approximately 25 minutes ride, which is a 3 kilometer round trip cruise. Hours: 8:00  20:30, Date of operation: March 25  April 09, 2017, Fare: 1,200 JPY.\nI am sure you can cover all these attractions within a day trip!\nKyoto Spring Itinerary  Day 2\nThe famous wooden stage of the Kiyomizudera.

The early you visit it the better it would be because it is awfully a crowded place.\nBeing one of the most visited places in Kyoto, many tourists tend to see this wonder and its surroundings natural beauty, especially in spring and autumn.\nHave you ever seen any Japanese rock garden before? If you have not then I strongly recommended you to pay a visit to\nKodaiji temple\n, it is worth a visit!\nGion street and old houses.

Heres the Best Way to Spend Them.\n6 March 2025\n25 November 2023\nAbout\nLatest Posts\nHelen Foster\nHelen Foster is a Sydney-based author, journalist and content creator. She has traveled to Japan six times and is planning trip seven. Her articles on Japan have appeared in publications including Reader's Digest (Asia Pacific), RAC Horizons, Jetstar Magazine, the Japan National Tourism Organisation website and more. She is a digital publisher member of the Australian Society of Travel Writers.\nLatest posts by Helen Foster\n(\nsee all\n)\nShould You Tip in Japan?\n- 6 February 2026\nDiscover Miyajima Island: The Perfect One Day Itinerary\n- 1 February 2026\nDoes Tokyo Disney Have Single Rider Lines?\n- 29 January 2026\nWe think four full days is the minimum time you need to see all of Kyotos best sights without rushing around too much  so how should you break that down? Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy.\nQuick Summary\nHeres how to break down four days in Kyoto\nDay One  Arashiyama\n: Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park\nDay Two  Higashiyama\n: Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda\nDay Three  Fushimi Inari and Gion:\nFushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine\nDay Four  Temples and Tea\n: Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho\nThis covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city  but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading.\nArticle by\nHelen Foster.\nDisclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our\nAffiliate Disclosure.\nThis plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights.\nTable of Contents\n[Open]\n[Close]\nDay One  Arashiyama\nDay Two  Higashiyama\nDay Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion\nDay Four: Temples and Tea\nAre You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season?\nDay One  Arashiyama\nStart your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan.\nStart at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\nAs I explained in my post on\nhow long to spend in Kyoto\n, one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds  and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first  ideally before 8 am.\nThe forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn  dont miss it.\nJaplanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji\nIf the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called\nOtagi Nenbutsu Ji.\nThis is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto.\nOtagi-Nenbutsu Ji\nis a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people  and every single one\nis different. Some are serious, but there are also statues with tennis rackets; one looks like its carrying a puppy, and theres even one carrying a teddy bear if you look hard enough; they have different facial expressions and hand positions, and every time I visit, I spot something new. Its wonderful. Do not miss it.\nOnce youve finished admiring the statues, walk south on the small road outside the temple.\nOptional Stop: Adashino Nenbutsuji\nAfter about 8 minutes of walking, youll reach a set of steps on your right. There is no sign, and youll just see a small gravel area, some bike parking, and a railing.\nThese steps lead you up to\nAdashino Nenbutsuji Temple\n. This temple contains 8000 carved statues that are dedicated to people who died without any relatives, and it is the burial place of over 1000 bodies. For this reason, they ask that you dont take any pictures once inside the memorial area.\nIts also for that reason that I dont really want to tell you the other thing thats hidden in Adashino Nenbutsuji, but if I dont, and you read about this on another blog, youre going to think I dont know what Im talking about, so here goes.\nTheres a bamboo forest in Adashino Nenbutsuji thats much quieter than the one in Arashiyama.\nIf you visit, though, remember that\nAdashino Nenbutsuji\nis a spiritual place dedicated to the souls of people who died alone. So, see the bamboo; take a picture  but to respect the temples history, keep any full-on Instagram photo shoots for the other forest.\nIf you miss the steps to the temple, dont worry; theres another more obvious entrance a bit further down on the right. You also use this set of steps to head out of the shrine.\nKeep Your Eyes Peeled\nNow, keep going South, heading toward the point marked Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street on the map. Keep your eye out for a display case on your right-hand side  it contains a mini scene of tiny egg people  the eggs are silk cocoons, and the shop\nAdashino Mayumura\nnearby sells the figures.\nYou can see more about their designs, check opening hours, and find the location of their other store on the main street of Arashiyama on the\nMayumura website\n.\nThere is also a most beautiful house down this street  the garden is stunning. Unfortunately, they now have signs outside asking you not to take photographs but to keep an eye out for it.\nOptional Stop: Gio-ji\nThere are two moss temples in Kyoto  one of them,\nSaiho ji\nrequires booking in advance, but the one close to where you are right now,\nGioji\nis open to anyone.\nThe mossy carpet is beautiful year-round, but this is also a popular spot to see cherry blossoms and autumn leaves.\nSee more about opening hours and other details of\nGioji temple\n.\nIf youre not in a rush, you can visit many of the smaller shrines and temples scattered around this area for another hour or two.\nLunch Stop\nIf youre hungry, there are a few restaurants in this area. I picked\nTsure Zure\n, which has affordable soba dishes. It opens at 11am, if you feel like an early lunch.\nOptional Stop: The Hair Shrine\nFollow the road south and pass a small, unobtrusive shrine called\nMikami-jinja\n. Its slightly dilapidated appearance is ironic as its a beauty shrine  people go there to pray for good hair!\nThis has probably taken up most of the morning, so when it comes to the afternoon, you have a couple of options on where to go next  trains, shops, or monkeys! Youre unlikely to get all three of these done  but you can probably fit in two of them.\nThe Train Option\nClose to this point is Torokko Arashiyama Station  where you can board the\nSagano Romantic Train.\nThis gives your feet a rest while you travel past a pretty gorge  in Autumn, the blue of the gorge and the red and yellow leaves make for a stunning scene.\nThe train becomes a\nKyoto Must-See\nthis time of year, and you\nmust book train seats well in advance\n.\nTry to snag seats on the right-hand side of the train going out, which have better views.\nSee more tips in our\nguide to going on the Sagano Romantic Train\n.\nIt doesnt always get as booked out",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds.\nCouple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto:\nUsa.Pin / Shutterstock.com\nIntroduction\nCherry blossom season (late March and early April)\nis a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees.\nCycling under the cherries in Kyoto:\nweniliou / Shutterstock.com\nFortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of\nSouthern Higashiyama\nduring the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between\nMaruyama-koen Park\nand\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\n. That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home).\nKiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season:\nSean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\nThe best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off.\nThe route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary.\nRomantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary\nDistance:\nAbout 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides\nTime required:\nAbout six hours (four in the day, two in the evening)\nSights:\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n,\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\n,\nShoren-in Temple\n,\nMaruyama-koen Park\n,\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nStarting point:\nImadegawa Station on the\nKarasuma Subway Line\nEnd Point:\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nKiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom:\nf11 photo / Shutterstock.com\nNote:\nRestaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to\nthe food floor of Daimaru\nor\nTakashimaya department stores\nand pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am.\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\nStart in the mid-morning. Take the\nKarasuma subway line\nto Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n(Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out.\nWeeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park:\nzzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com\nWalk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens\nAfter enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\n. If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many beautiful cherry trees en route. Walk east along Imadegawa-dori Street for about 700 meters until you reach the\nKamo-gawa River\n. At Demachiyanagi (where the Kamo-gawa and Katsura-gawa rivers meet), take a left and walk upstream along the Kamo-gawa (its the first river you come to). The river is lined on both sides with great cherry trees and you will surely see many hanami (flower viewing) parties in progress. After about two kilometers, you will come to the southern entrance to the Botanical Gardens above the east bank of the river. Climb the bank and follow the road that parallels the river to reach the entrance. If you choose to take the subway from the Imperial Palace Park, just return to Imadegawa Station and take it north three stops north to the Kitayama stop.\nCherries along the Kamo-gawa River:\nYUSHENG HSU / Shutterstock.com\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\nIf youve walked here, enter through the southern entrance. If youve taken the subway, youll enter through the north entrance. There are several cherry arbors here, mostly in the middle and north end of the gardens. You should be able to find a nice secluded tree to have all to yourselves.\nCherries in the Kyoto Botanical Gardens:\nweniliou / Shutterstock.com\nSubway Downtown to Hotel and Rest\nAfter a picnic lunch and a nap under a tree at the Botanical Gardens, make your way to Kitayama Station (at the north end of the gardens) and take the subway down to your hotel or ryokan to freshen up and take a rest. Eat dinner somewhere\ndowntown\n(you might want to reserve a place through your hotel or ryokan).\nKyoto subway interior:\nTupungato / Shutterstock.com\nSubway to Higashiyama Station\nAfter dinner, take\nthe Tozai subway line\nto Higashiyama Station. Walk along Sanjo-dori Street and take a right and walk up Jingu-michi Street.\nYoung lady on the Kyoto subway:\noneinchpunch / Shutterstock.com\nShoren-in Temple\nThe first major sight for this evening is\nShoren-in Temple\n, where a light up is held during cherry blossom season starting at 6.30pm. This temple isnt really a cherry blossom destination, but its very beautiful and the bamboo grove here is magical. Best of all, its not usually crowded.\nShoren-in Temple during evening light up:\nMyPixelDiaries / Shutterstock.com\nWalk from Shoren-in Maruyama-koen Park\nLeave Shoren-in, take a left and walk south along Jingu-michi. Youll soon see the incredible Gate of\nChion-in Temple\ntowering above you on your left. It will be illuminated in cherry blossom season. If youre interested, you can pay to enter, but we usually just like to admire it from street level. Just past Chion-in, youll come to the entrance to\nMaruyama-koen Park\n.\nChion-in Gate during cherry blossom season  image  Chris Rowthorn\nMaruyama-koen Park\nOkay, we said that youd avoid the crowds on this route, but theres no avoiding them here  and you shouldnt \nMaruyama-koen\nis the most\npopular place in Kyoto for nighttime hanami\n. The place is festive and fun. At the heart of the park is one large, famous cherry tree that looks like a frozen white explosion. Nearby you will see tables set up beneath cherry trees where you can order sake, beer and snacks.\nThe central cherry tree at Maruyama-koen in the evening:\nSean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\nWalk to Kiyomizu-dera Temple\nAfter enjoying the scene at\nMaruyama-koen Park\n, walk south (away from the central cherry tree), keeping the pond on your left and the Choraku-kan Hotel on your right. Its a slight uphill. Keep going straight for about 100 meters until you come to a T-junction. Turn right (downhill) and then take your first left. This attractive lane is called\nNene-no-Michi Lane\n. Youll pass several temples including Kodai-ji and Entoku-in. At the end of this section, youll go left (uphill) briefly and then take a right into\nNinen-zaka\n. Follow this, climb the steps and then work your way up\nSannen-zaka\n, which brings you out to the road that leads up to the entrance to\nKiyomizu-dera\n, which you will enter.\nNight view of the famous Maruyama Par",

The itinerary planning, coordination, and execution were handled efficiently, which made our trip largely stress-free. The arrangements and logistics were good, and the team was available throughout the trip for support whenever we needed assistance, which was reassuring in a foreign country like Japan. That said, the stay could have been a little better in terms of quality and room space, and keeping a backup plan (in terms of transport availability) would have further made our experience better.

Whether you visit Kyoto from either Osaka or Tokyo, make sure you dont miss the full bloom period.

Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nPlaces of Interest:\nKyoto Botanical Garden, Kyoto Imperial Palace, Ginkakuji Temple, Philosophers Path, Heian Shrine (optional), Keage Incline,\nand\nOkazaki Canal\n.\nDuring hanami, it is always great to start the day with a trip either to\nKyoto Botanical Garden or Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyto Gosho)\n. Decide yourself which one you would visit first.\nKyoto botanical garden is arguably famous for viewing hundreds of Somei Yoshino & weeping cherry (a popular sakura variety in Japan), and picnicking. Besides, you can experience stunning tulip flowerbed there.\nA weeping cherry tree at Kyoto Imperial Palace garden. Photo Credit: mrhayata at Flickr.\nKyoto Imperial Palace\n, one of the famous historic attractions in Kyoto has a beautiful park called\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n. In fact, the Palace is surrounded by this decent and specious park.\nMany tourists and locals alike visit the park in the spring with an intention of seeing early-blooming\nShidarezakura\n(weeping cherry trees). You can find them in a small grove located in the northwest corner of the park.\nYou can gladly spend one and half an hour there. Its up to you though.\nGinkakujis Silver Pavilion.

Explore Silver Pavilion, the Hondo, Togudo, Sand garden and Moss garden.\nThe Philosophers Path and glorious cherry blossom along the canal. Photo Credit: fortherock at Flickr.\nYour next destination would be the\nPhilosophers Path\n(Tetsugaku no michi). It is one of my favorite cherry blossom viewing spot in Kyoto. It is extremely enjoying when you take a stroll along the path that follows a canal which is lined by hundreds of sakura trees.\nAlong the way you would discover many small bridges, use them to take awesome photographs of cherry blossoms. Also cafes and restaurants can easily be found along the walkway, so have your lunch there!\nThe Okazaki canal looks pretty in spring. Photo Credit: Kimon Berlin at Flickr.\nIf you want to experience something unique out of your trip, take a trip to\nHeian Shrine\n. You will find a garden there with many weeping cherry trees.\nWhether you visit it or not, make sure you a pleasant boat ride in the\nOkazaki canal\n. Before you boarding the sightseeing boat, you should get to\nKeage Incline\n. I wont tell about this hanami spot, leave it alone, just go there and explore something incredible!\nThe boat departs every 15 minutes from the Nanzenji Boat Pier and return via Ebisugawa Dam to the pier. It is approximately 25 minutes ride, which is a 3 kilometer round trip cruise. Hours: 8:00  20:30, Date of operation: March 25  April 09, 2017, Fare: 1,200 JPY.\nI am sure you can cover all these attractions within a day trip!\nKyoto Spring Itinerary  Day 2\nThe famous wooden stage of the Kiyomizudera.

The neighborhood has an abundance of important heritage such as old fashioned buildings, streets, and merchants shops.\nThe rock garden at Kodaiji temple. Photo Credit: zynke at Flickr.\nIt is always positive to start your trip at\nKiyomizudera\n(a Buddhist temple part of\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nand famous for its wooden stage). The early you visit it the better it would be because it is awfully a crowded place.\nBeing one of the most visited places in Kyoto, many tourists tend to see this wonder and its surroundings natural beauty, especially in spring and autumn.\nHave you ever seen any Japanese rock garden before? If you have not then I strongly recommended you to pay a visit to\nKodaiji temple\n, it is worth a visit!\nGion street and old houses.

Heres the Best Way to Spend Them.\n6 March 2025\n25 November 2023\nAbout\nLatest Posts\nHelen Foster\nHelen Foster is a Sydney-based author, journalist and content creator. She has traveled to Japan six times and is planning trip seven. Her articles on Japan have appeared in publications including Reader's Digest (Asia Pacific), RAC Horizons, Jetstar Magazine, the Japan National Tourism Organisation website and more. She is a digital publisher member of the Australian Society of Travel Writers.\nLatest posts by Helen Foster\n(\nsee all\n)\nShould You Tip in Japan?\n- 6 February 2026\nDiscover Miyajima Island: The Perfect One Day Itinerary\n- 1 February 2026\nDoes Tokyo Disney Have Single Rider Lines?\n- 29 January 2026\nWe think four full days is the minimum time you need to see all of Kyotos best sights without rushing around too much  so how should you break that down? Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy.\nQuick Summary\nHeres how to break down four days in Kyoto\nDay One  Arashiyama\n: Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park\nDay Two  Higashiyama\n: Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda\nDay Three  Fushimi Inari and Gion:\nFushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine\nDay Four  Temples and Tea\n: Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho\nThis covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city  but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading.\nArticle by\nHelen Foster.\nDisclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our\nAffiliate Disclosure.\nThis plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights.\nTable of Contents\n[Open]\n[Close]\nDay One  Arashiyama\nDay Two  Higashiyama\nDay Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion\nDay Four: Temples and Tea\nAre You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season?\nDay One  Arashiyama\nStart your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan.\nStart at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\nAs I explained in my post on\nhow long to spend in Kyoto\n, one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds  and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first  ideally before 8 am.\nThe forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn  dont miss it.\nJaplanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji\nIf the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called\nOtagi Nenbutsu Ji.\nThis is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto.\nOtagi-Nenbutsu Ji\nis a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people  and every single one\nis different. Some are serious, but there are also statues with tennis rackets; one looks like its carrying a puppy, and theres even one carrying a teddy bear if you look hard enough; they have different facial expressions and hand positions, and every time I visit, I spot something new. Its wonderful. Do not miss it.\nOnce youve finished admiring the statues, walk south on the small road outside the temple.\nOptional Stop: Adashino Nenbutsuji\nAfter about 8 minutes of walking, youll reach a set of steps on your right. There is no sign, and youll just see a small gravel area, some bike parking, and a railing.\nThese steps lead you up to\nAdashino Nenbutsuji Temple\n. This temple contains 8000 carved statues that are dedicated to people who died without any relatives, and it is the burial place of over 1000 bodies. For this reason, they ask that you dont take any pictures once inside the memorial area.\nIts also for that reason that I dont really want to tell you the other thing thats hidden in Adashino Nenbutsuji, but if I dont, and you read about this on another blog, youre going to think I dont know what Im talking about, so here goes.\nTheres a bamboo forest in Adashino Nenbutsuji thats much quieter than the one in Arashiyama.\nIf you visit, though, remember that\nAdashino Nenbutsuji\nis a spiritual place dedicated to the souls of people who died alone. So, see the bamboo; take a picture  but to respect the temples history, keep any full-on Instagram photo shoots for the other forest.\nIf you miss the steps to the temple, dont worry; theres another more obvious entrance a bit further down on the right. You also use this set of steps to head out of the shrine.\nKeep Your Eyes Peeled\nNow, keep going South, heading toward the point marked Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street on the map. Keep your eye out for a display case on your right-hand side  it contains a mini scene of tiny egg people  the eggs are silk cocoons, and the shop\nAdashino Mayumura\nnearby sells the figures.\nYou can see more about their designs, check opening hours, and find the location of their other store on the main street of Arashiyama on the\nMayumura website\n.\nThere is also a most beautiful house down this street  the garden is stunning. Unfortunately, they now have signs outside asking you not to take photographs but to keep an eye out for it.\nOptional Stop: Gio-ji\nThere are two moss temples in Kyoto  one of them,\nSaiho ji\nrequires booking in advance, but the one close to where you are right now,\nGioji\nis open to anyone.\nThe mossy carpet is beautiful year-round, but this is also a popular spot to see cherry blossoms and autumn leaves.\nSee more about opening hours and other details of\nGioji temple\n.\nIf youre not in a rush, you can visit many of the smaller shrines and temples scattered around this area for another hour or two.\nLunch Stop\nIf youre hungry, there are a few restaurants in this area. I picked\nTsure Zure\n, which has affordable soba dishes. It opens at 11am, if you feel like an early lunch.\nOptional Stop: The Hair Shrine\nFollow the road south and pass a small, unobtrusive shrine called\nMikami-jinja\n. Its slightly dilapidated appearance is ironic as its a beauty shrine  people go there to pray for good hair!\nThis has probably taken up most of the morning, so when it comes to the afternoon, you have a couple of options on where to go next  trains, shops, or monkeys! Youre unlikely to get all three of these done  but you can probably fit in two of them.\nThe Train Option\nClose to this point is Torokko Arashiyama Station  where you can board the\nSagano Romantic Train.\nThis gives your feet a rest while you travel past a pretty gorge  in Autumn, the blue of the gorge and the red and yellow leaves make for a stunning scene.\nThe train becomes a\nKyoto Must-See\nthis time of year, and you\nmust book train seats well in advance\n.\nTry to snag seats on the right-hand side of the train going out, which have better views.\nSee more tips in our\nguide to going on the Sagano Romantic Train\n.\nIt doesnt always get as booked out",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds.\nCouple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto:\nUsa.Pin / Shutterstock.com\nIntroduction\nCherry blossom season (late March and early April)\nis a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees.\nCycling under the cherries in Kyoto:\nweniliou / Shutterstock.com\nFortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of\nSouthern Higashiyama\nduring the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between\nMaruyama-koen Park\nand\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\n. That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home).\nKiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season:\nSean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\nThe best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off.\nThe route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary.\nRomantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary\nDistance:\nAbout 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides\nTime required:\nAbout six hours (four in the day, two in the evening)\nSights:\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n,\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\n,\nShoren-in Temple\n,\nMaruyama-koen Park\n,\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nStarting point:\nImadegawa Station on the\nKarasuma Subway Line\nEnd Point:\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nKiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom:\nf11 photo / Shutterstock.com\nNote:\nRestaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to\nthe food floor of Daimaru\nor\nTakashimaya department stores\nand pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am.\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\nStart in the mid-morning. Take the\nKarasuma subway line\nto Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the\nKyoto Imperial Palace Park\n(Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out.\nWeeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park:\nzzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com\nWalk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens\nAfter enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\n. If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many beautiful cherry trees en route. Walk east along Imadegawa-dori Street for about 700 meters until you reach the\nKamo-gawa River\n. At Demachiyanagi (where the Kamo-gawa and Katsura-gawa rivers meet), take a left and walk upstream along the Kamo-gawa (its the first river you come to). The river is lined on both sides with great cherry trees and you will surely see many hanami (flower viewing) parties in progress. After about two kilometers, you will come to the southern entrance to the Botanical Gardens above the east bank of the river. Climb the bank and follow the road that parallels the river to reach the entrance. If you choose to take the subway from the Imperial Palace Park, just return to Imadegawa Station and take it north three stops north to the Kitayama stop.\nCherries along the Kamo-gawa River:\nYUSHENG HSU / Shutterstock.com\nKyoto Botanical Gardens\nIf youve walked here, enter through the southern entrance. If youve taken the subway, youll enter through the north entrance. There are several cherry arbors here, mostly in the middle and north end of the gardens. You should be able to find a nice secluded tree to have all to yourselves.\nCherries in the Kyoto Botanical Gardens:\nweniliou / Shutterstock.com\nSubway Downtown to Hotel and Rest\nAfter a picnic lunch and a nap under a tree at the Botanical Gardens, make your way to Kitayama Station (at the north end of the gardens) and take the subway down to your hotel or ryokan to freshen up and take a rest. Eat dinner somewhere\ndowntown\n(you might want to reserve a place through your hotel or ryokan).\nKyoto subway interior:\nTupungato / Shutterstock.com\nSubway to Higashiyama Station\nAfter dinner, take\nthe Tozai subway line\nto Higashiyama Station. Walk along Sanjo-dori Street and take a right and walk up Jingu-michi Street.\nYoung lady on the Kyoto subway:\noneinchpunch / Shutterstock.com\nShoren-in Temple\nThe first major sight for this evening is\nShoren-in Temple\n, where a light up is held during cherry blossom season starting at 6.30pm. This temple isnt really a cherry blossom destination, but its very beautiful and the bamboo grove here is magical. Best of all, its not usually crowded.\nShoren-in Temple during evening light up:\nMyPixelDiaries / Shutterstock.com\nWalk from Shoren-in Maruyama-koen Park\nLeave Shoren-in, take a left and walk south along Jingu-michi. Youll soon see the incredible Gate of\nChion-in Temple\ntowering above you on your left. It will be illuminated in cherry blossom season. If youre interested, you can pay to enter, but we usually just like to admire it from street level. Just past Chion-in, youll come to the entrance to\nMaruyama-koen Park\n.\nChion-in Gate during cherry blossom season  image  Chris Rowthorn\nMaruyama-koen Park\nOkay, we said that youd avoid the crowds on this route, but theres no avoiding them here  and you shouldnt \nMaruyama-koen\nis the most\npopular place in Kyoto for nighttime hanami\n. The place is festive and fun. At the heart of the park is one large, famous cherry tree that looks like a frozen white explosion. Nearby you will see tables set up beneath cherry trees where you can order sake, beer and snacks.\nThe central cherry tree at Maruyama-koen in the evening:\nSean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\nWalk to Kiyomizu-dera Temple\nAfter enjoying the scene at\nMaruyama-koen Park\n, walk south (away from the central cherry tree), keeping the pond on your left and the Choraku-kan Hotel on your right. Its a slight uphill. Keep going straight for about 100 meters until you come to a T-junction. Turn right (downhill) and then take your first left. This attractive lane is called\nNene-no-Michi Lane\n. Youll pass several temples including Kodai-ji and Entoku-in. At the end of this section, youll go left (uphill) briefly and then take a right into\nNinen-zaka\n. Follow this, climb the steps and then work your way up\nSannen-zaka\n, which brings you out to the road that leads up to the entrance to\nKiyomizu-dera\n, which you will enter.\nNight view of the famous Maruyama Par",

The itinerary planning, coordination, and execution were handled efficiently, which made our trip largely stress-free. The arrangements and logistics were good, and the team was available throughout the trip for support whenever we needed assistance, which was reassuring in a foreign country like Japan. That said, the stay could have been a little better in terms of quality and room space, and keeping a backup plan (in terms of transport availability) would have further made our experience better.
