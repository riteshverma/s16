But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",

Kyoto's cherry blossoms offer the most beautiful scenery of delicate sakura (cherry tree flowers) set against ancient buildings, within historical temples, and amid charming gardens. The cherry blossom season in Kyoto is similar to that of Tokyo and Osaka. Here is a guide to the Kyoto cherry blossom season: when and where to see the cherry blossoms and travel suggestions. Hirano Shrine cherry blossom When to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto 2026? Best time to see : April 2/3-April 10 Cherry blossom season : Late March to mid-April The cherry blossoms and red shrine create an ultimate sense of beauty The best time to view cherry blossoms in Kyoto is from April 2/3 to April 10, when the majority of cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Kyoto's cherry blossom season lasts from late March to mid-April, with most trees blooming in early April. Early blooms can be seen in late March at Maruyama Park and Kodaiji Temple, while late blooms extend to mid-April at Heian Shrine and Ninna-ji Temple. If you travel in spring with us, our guide will help you find the best cherry blossoms around. In 2025, the full blooms occurred around April 5 , and the best viewing periods were from April 3 to April 10. When we visited on April 7th, we saw the spectacular full blooms. In 2026, the cherry blossom season in Kyoto is likely to fall within this period. The 10 Best Places to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto Kyoto's cherry blossom season offers a unique charm with its historic atmosphere. To truly feel it, take a slow stroll along the Philosopher's Path or explore the hillside views at Kiyomizu-dera Temple. For something unique, hop on a traditional boat along the Fushimi Jikkokubune Canal and glide beneath blooming sakura trees, surrounded by Kyoto's old-town charm. 1. Philosopher's Path Philosopher's Path cherry blossom, April 7, 2025 Best viewing time : early April Philosopher's Path is a tranquil stone path along a winding, narrow canal. Both sides of the canal are densely lined with tall cherry trees. It is named after a famous philosopher, Nishida Kitaro, who used to meditate while walking there. The trail is a gorgeous place to enjoy a leisurely walk with your family or loved one. To make the most of your visit, start your walk along the path and continue to Nanzen-ji Temple, with a detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. This popular Kyoto trail offers more than just cherry blossoms; you'll also encounter historic buildings and two hidden temples. The whole tour takes about 2 hours. Enjoy a walk along the Philosopher's Path, and take a short detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. Visit before 10 a.m. for a peaceful stroll away from the crowds. The period from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. is the busiest, so it's best to avoid this time if you prefer a quieter experience. The path is illuminated in the evening. Along the path, there are small houses serving as restaurants and coffee shops. The path is smooth and accessible, with no steps or inclines, making it suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, and prams. 2. Kiyomizu-dera Temple Cherry blossoms at Kiyomizu-dera Temple The white and pink cherry blossoms against the red buildings of Kiyomizu-dera create an intimate beauty. During my visit, I was so captivated by the scenery that I couldn't stop saying \"wow.\" I couldn't help but keep taking photos, capturing every corner",

Please read our disclosure for more info. The Kyoto cherry blossom season is a big deal. Locals and tourists flock to the city in spring for the fleeting week or two when the cherry trees bloom. Cherry blossoms (sakura in Japanese) are found everywhere in Kyotoalong canals and streets and in parks and temples. They are a truly magical sight. Locals take sakura viewing (hanami) seriously and they hit the parks in big groups for picnics to admire the flowers, drink, and eat cherry blossom themed food (mmm, sakura and sake kit kats!). It may be crowded, but its a joyous time, and we did manage to find some quieter spots. In this post, I share our favourite places to see the Kyoto cherry blossoms. You could visit most of the spots in Gion and Higashiyama in one day. Its best to spend at least a few days in Kyoto, though, so that you can visit the popular sakura spots early in the morning to avoid the crowds. After our time in Kyoto we spent three weeks travelling around Japan and managed to follow the blossoms. Below Ive included my tips on other less crowded sakura spots beyond Kyoto. This post also includes the Kyoto cherry blossom forecast for 2026. Contents The Best Time to Visit Kyoto for Cherry Blossoms Kyoto Cherry Blossom Forecast for 2026 Where to Stay for Kyoto Sakura Season Popular Kyoto Cherry Blossom Spots Kyoto Sakura Spots to Avoid the Crowds Kyoto Cherry Blossom Map Other Kyoto Spring Activities Sakura Beyond Kyoto Is Kyoto Cherry Blossom Season Worth it? More Japan Posts The Best Time to Visit Kyoto for Cherry Blossoms Its difficult to plan a trip to Kyoto to see the cherry blossoms as every year they bloom at different times. Sakura usually happens in late March or early Aprilthe first week of April is probably the safest bet if you need to plan in advance. A few months beforehand you can follow the sakura forecasts to see the estimated bloom dates. This will include the date for the first bloom (when the blossoms first start to appear) and the full bloom (when most flowers are blooming). Full bloom happens about a week after first bloom and lasts for about a week. Bad weather can reduce the blooming period, though. If possible, try to time your trip for the start of the full bloom. The sakura forecasts refer to the somei yoshino, which is the most popular variety of cherry tree with pale pink five-petal blossoms. There are other varieties of sakura that you may be able to see before or after the official cherry blossom season. In 2025, Kyotos cherry blossoms had the first bloom on 27 March and full bloom on 5 April lasting until around 12 April. Plan as much as you can, but dont stress too much about predicting the perfect dates. Even if you miss the sakura, there are so many amazing things to do in Kyoto that youll still have a wonderful trip. Our Experience of Kyoto Sakura Season Even early in the season we found cherry trees blooming like this one at Takenaka Inari Shrine, one of our recommended quiet sakura spots On our Kyoto sakura trip, the first bloom was officially 27 March, but the trees were only just beginning to flower then. We found the occasional",

Its a super unique way to actually participate in Japanese culture rather than just looking at it from behind a barrier. Ill be honest with you: I was actually pretty skeptical at the beginning. I wasnt sure if it would feel too touristy or just be a bit awkward, but I ended up enjoying it so much. Its a lot more interactive than I expected, and it really gives you a deeper appreciation for how much thought goes into every single movement in Japanese traditions. I did my tea ceremony in downtown Kyoto at a beautiful, small tea house. The experience started with a kimono dress-up, followed by the ceremony itself where we were taught the proper way to make matcha. Afterward, we had some time to wander around and take photos in their cute little Zen garden, which was a nice touch. In this guide, I want to share my own experience because I know exactly how it feels to be on the fence about whether its worth the time and money. Ive put together this quick guide to give you some honest insights and my personal recommendations for how, and where, to book your own tea ceremony in Kyoto. In a Rush?

So here is my quick overview! Cost: Around $60 USD (This usually includes the kimono rental, hair styling, and the actual ceremony). Location: Kyoto Downtown (I stayed in Kyoto Downtown myself so I just walked there from my hotel!) Booking: I always use these platforms because their support is great if plans change: Click here for booking with Viator Click here for booking with GetYourGuide Who is it For: Friends, families, and couples. And guys, dont let the kimono part scare you off! Oliver actually loved it, so I promise youll enjoy it too. Tea Ceremony in Kyoto My Experience I feel like the best way to show you if this is actually worth it, and what you should really expect, is to just talk about my own experience. To be honest, I ended up at the tea ceremony because I was visiting Kyoto with a group of my friends and it was actually their idea and they set up the whole thing. I obviously agreed because I didnt want to miss out, but to be honest, I was definitely super skeptical. At the time, I wasnt even that excited about it. I think I was expecting some super touristy, cringy situation where we all just wear costumes, so I didnt exactly go in with the best mood. However, as soon as we started, I was immediately convinced. The tea house where we met",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",

Kyoto's cherry blossoms offer the most beautiful scenery of delicate sakura (cherry tree flowers) set against ancient buildings, within historical temples, and amid charming gardens. The cherry blossom season in Kyoto is similar to that of Tokyo and Osaka. Here is a guide to the Kyoto cherry blossom season: when and where to see the cherry blossoms and travel suggestions. Hirano Shrine cherry blossom When to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto 2026? Best time to see : April 2/3-April 10 Cherry blossom season : Late March to mid-April The cherry blossoms and red shrine create an ultimate sense of beauty The best time to view cherry blossoms in Kyoto is from April 2/3 to April 10, when the majority of cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Kyoto's cherry blossom season lasts from late March to mid-April, with most trees blooming in early April. Early blooms can be seen in late March at Maruyama Park and Kodaiji Temple, while late blooms extend to mid-April at Heian Shrine and Ninna-ji Temple. If you travel in spring with us, our guide will help you find the best cherry blossoms around. In 2025, the full blooms occurred around April 5 , and the best viewing periods were from April 3 to April 10. When we visited on April 7th, we saw the spectacular full blooms. In 2026, the cherry blossom season in Kyoto is likely to fall within this period. The 10 Best Places to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto Kyoto's cherry blossom season offers a unique charm with its historic atmosphere. To truly feel it, take a slow stroll along the Philosopher's Path or explore the hillside views at Kiyomizu-dera Temple. For something unique, hop on a traditional boat along the Fushimi Jikkokubune Canal and glide beneath blooming sakura trees, surrounded by Kyoto's old-town charm. 1. Philosopher's Path Philosopher's Path cherry blossom, April 7, 2025 Best viewing time : early April Philosopher's Path is a tranquil stone path along a winding, narrow canal. Both sides of the canal are densely lined with tall cherry trees. It is named after a famous philosopher, Nishida Kitaro, who used to meditate while walking there. The trail is a gorgeous place to enjoy a leisurely walk with your family or loved one. To make the most of your visit, start your walk along the path and continue to Nanzen-ji Temple, with a detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. This popular Kyoto trail offers more than just cherry blossoms; you'll also encounter historic buildings and two hidden temples. The whole tour takes about 2 hours. Enjoy a walk along the Philosopher's Path, and take a short detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. Visit before 10 a.m. for a peaceful stroll away from the crowds. The period from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. is the busiest, so it's best to avoid this time if you prefer a quieter experience. The path is illuminated in the evening. Along the path, there are small houses serving as restaurants and coffee shops. The path is smooth and accessible, with no steps or inclines, making it suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, and prams. 2. Kiyomizu-dera Temple Cherry blossoms at Kiyomizu-dera Temple The white and pink cherry blossoms against the red buildings of Kiyomizu-dera create an intimate beauty. During my visit, I was so captivated by the scenery that I couldn't stop saying \"wow.\" I couldn't help but keep taking photos, capturing every corner",

Please read our disclosure for more info. The Kyoto cherry blossom season is a big deal. Locals and tourists flock to the city in spring for the fleeting week or two when the cherry trees bloom. Cherry blossoms (sakura in Japanese) are found everywhere in Kyotoalong canals and streets and in parks and temples. They are a truly magical sight. Locals take sakura viewing (hanami) seriously and they hit the parks in big groups for picnics to admire the flowers, drink, and eat cherry blossom themed food (mmm, sakura and sake kit kats!). It may be crowded, but its a joyous time, and we did manage to find some quieter spots. In this post, I share our favourite places to see the Kyoto cherry blossoms. You could visit most of the spots in Gion and Higashiyama in one day. Its best to spend at least a few days in Kyoto, though, so that you can visit the popular sakura spots early in the morning to avoid the crowds. After our time in Kyoto we spent three weeks travelling around Japan and managed to follow the blossoms. Below Ive included my tips on other less crowded sakura spots beyond Kyoto. This post also includes the Kyoto cherry blossom forecast for 2026. Contents The Best Time to Visit Kyoto for Cherry Blossoms Kyoto Cherry Blossom Forecast for 2026 Where to Stay for Kyoto Sakura Season Popular Kyoto Cherry Blossom Spots Kyoto Sakura Spots to Avoid the Crowds Kyoto Cherry Blossom Map Other Kyoto Spring Activities Sakura Beyond Kyoto Is Kyoto Cherry Blossom Season Worth it? More Japan Posts The Best Time to Visit Kyoto for Cherry Blossoms Its difficult to plan a trip to Kyoto to see the cherry blossoms as every year they bloom at different times. Sakura usually happens in late March or early Aprilthe first week of April is probably the safest bet if you need to plan in advance. A few months beforehand you can follow the sakura forecasts to see the estimated bloom dates. This will include the date for the first bloom (when the blossoms first start to appear) and the full bloom (when most flowers are blooming). Full bloom happens about a week after first bloom and lasts for about a week. Bad weather can reduce the blooming period, though. If possible, try to time your trip for the start of the full bloom. The sakura forecasts refer to the somei yoshino, which is the most popular variety of cherry tree with pale pink five-petal blossoms. There are other varieties of sakura that you may be able to see before or after the official cherry blossom season. In 2025, Kyotos cherry blossoms had the first bloom on 27 March and full bloom on 5 April lasting until around 12 April. Plan as much as you can, but dont stress too much about predicting the perfect dates. Even if you miss the sakura, there are so many amazing things to do in Kyoto that youll still have a wonderful trip.

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",

Early blooms can be seen in late March at Maruyama Park and Kodaiji Temple, while late blooms extend to mid-April at Heian Shrine and Ninna-ji Temple. If you travel in spring with us, our guide will help you find the best cherry blossoms around. In 2025, the full blooms occurred around April 5 , and the best viewing periods were from April 3 to April 10. When we visited on April 7th, we saw the spectacular full blooms. In 2026, the cherry blossom season in Kyoto is likely to fall within this period. The 10 Best Places to See Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto Kyoto's cherry blossom season offers a unique charm with its historic atmosphere. To truly feel it, take a slow stroll along the Philosopher's Path or explore the hillside views at Kiyomizu-dera Temple. For something unique, hop on a traditional boat along the Fushimi Jikkokubune Canal and glide beneath blooming sakura trees, surrounded by Kyoto's old-town charm. 1. Philosopher's Path Philosopher's Path cherry blossom, April 7, 2025 Best viewing time : early April Philosopher's Path is a tranquil stone path along a winding, narrow canal. Both sides of the canal are densely lined with tall cherry trees. It is named after a famous philosopher, Nishida Kitaro, who used to meditate while walking there. The trail is a gorgeous place to enjoy a leisurely walk with your family or loved one. To make the most of your visit, start your walk along the path and continue to Nanzen-ji Temple, with a detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. This popular Kyoto trail offers more than just cherry blossoms; you'll also encounter historic buildings and two hidden temples. The whole tour takes about 2 hours. Enjoy a walk along the Philosopher's Path, and take a short detour to explore Ginkaku-ji Temple. Visit before 10 a.m. for a peaceful stroll away from the crowds. The period from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. is the busiest, so it's best to avoid this time if you prefer a quieter experience. The path is illuminated in the evening. Along the path, there are small houses serving as restaurants and coffee shops. The path is smooth and accessible, with no steps or inclines, making it suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, and prams. 2.

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",

Its a super unique way to actually participate in Japanese culture rather than just looking at it from behind a barrier. Ill be honest with you: I was actually pretty skeptical at the beginning. I wasnt sure if it would feel too touristy or just be a bit awkward, but I ended up enjoying it so much. Its a lot more interactive than I expected, and it really gives you a deeper appreciation for how much thought goes into every single movement in Japanese traditions. I did my tea ceremony in downtown Kyoto at a beautiful, small tea house. The experience started with a kimono dress-up, followed by the ceremony itself where we were taught the proper way to make matcha. Afterward, we had some time to wander around and take photos in their cute little Zen garden, which was a nice touch. In this guide, I want to share my own experience because I know exactly how it feels to be on the fence about whether its worth the time and money. Ive put together this quick guide to give you some honest insights and my personal recommendations for how, and where, to book your own tea ceremony in Kyoto. In a Rush?

And guys, dont let the kimono part scare you off! Oliver actually loved it, so I promise youll enjoy it too. Tea Ceremony in Kyoto My Experience I feel like the best way to show you if this is actually worth it, and what you should really expect, is to just talk about my own experience. To be honest, I ended up at the tea ceremony because I was visiting Kyoto with a group of my friends and it was actually their idea and they set up the whole thing. I obviously agreed because I didnt want to miss out, but to be honest, I was definitely super skeptical. At the time, I wasnt even that excited about it. I think I was expecting some super touristy, cringy situation where we all just wear costumes, so I didnt exactly go in with the best mood. However, as soon as we started, I was immediately convinced. The tea house where we met",
