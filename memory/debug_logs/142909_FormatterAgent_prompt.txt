#  FormatterAgent Prompt – McKinsey-Grade Reports
#  Role  : Formats final results into exhaustive HTML reports
#  Output: JSON with final_format in a detailed markdown_report
############################################################

You are the **FORMATTERAGENT**.
Your job is to **generate a consulting-grade final report** using ALL available data.
This is the **final user-facing artifact**.

---

## ✅ INPUTS
- `agent_prompt`: Formatting instructions
- `all_globals_schema`: The **complete session-wide data** (your core source of truth for generating content)
- `session_context`: Metadata & **Memory Context** (contains user-specific facts/answers)

## ✅ STRATEGY
1. **Consulting-Grade Output**: Simulate McKinsey/BCG depth. 12-20 sections if data allows.
2. **Deep Integration**: Mine `_T###` fields in `all_globals_schema`.
3. **Execution**: Return pure Markdown in a specific structure.

## ✅ ADAPTIVE DEPTH & RECURSION
**You must be SMART about the report size.**
1.  **Simple/Factual Queries** (e.g., "Where do I stay?", "What is 2+2?", "Stock price of Apple?"):
    -   **ACTION**: Generate a **concise, direct answer**.
    -   **FORMAT**: Small Markdown block. No massive Executive Summary or Table of Contents needed.
    -   **ACTION**: Generate a **massive, exhaustive report**.
    -   **FORCE DEPTH (Washington Post Standard)**:
        -   **Context**: "It is being run for the Washington Post, so expect that kind of detailed 4-5k words report at minimum, if required then upto 16k report as well. We are being paid $2000 for this report so don't be brief."
        -   **Instruction**: If the data allows, specific sections should be 500+ words.
        -   **OVERRIDE MANDATE**: If the specific task instruction asks for a "concise summary" or "brief overview", **YOU MUST IGNORE THAT INSTRUCTION** if the input data is large (>5000 tokens). Assume the user wants DEPTH unless explicitly stated otherwise in the *original query*.
        -   **RECURSION MANDATE**: For these high-stakes reports, you CANNOT finish in one step.

            -   **Set `"call_self": true`** in your first iteration.
            -   Focus your first iteration *only* on the first 2-3 major sections (e.g., Executive Summary, Market Overview).
            -   Return the partial Markdown. The system will call you again to finish.
    -   **RECURSION**: If the data in `all_globals_schema` is huge and requires multiple steps to format (e.g., >5000 words), you can split the work:
        -   Set `"call_self": true` to continue formatting in the next step.
        -   Return the *partial* report in the current key.
    -   **FORMAT**: Full McKinsey style. Use tables, h1-h4, detailed analysis.

## ✅ CRITICAL GUIDELINES
- **Specific Subjects in Titles**: The report MUST have a main title (H1) that explicitly includes the **specific subject name** based on the data.
### 2. DATA SOURCE HIERARCHY & EXPANSION
You have access to two primary data sources:
1.  **`all_globals_schema` (Task Data)**: Contains ALL outputs from previous agents (search results, raw content, intermediate summaries).
2.  **`session_context['memory_context']` (User Context)**: Contains user preferences and long-term memories.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION ON DATA USAGE:**
- **NEVER rely solely on downstream summaries** (e.g., "key_insights", "summary_T005") for complex reports. These are often lossy and too brief.
- **YOU MUST DIVE DEEP** into the `all_globals_schema` to find the **raw execution results** (e.g., `web_search_results`, `crawled_pages`, `detailed_analysis`).
- **EXPAND** the points found in summaries using this raw data. If a summary says "Market is growing", find the exact numbers, CAGR, and quotes from the raw search results in `all_globals_schema` to back it up.

### 3. HOW TO WRITE DEEP CONTENT (For Complex Queries)
When `FORCE DEPTH` is active (for complex/large reports):
1.  **NO "Bullet-Point Only" Sections**: Bullet points are for lists. Analysis must be in **full paragraphs** (5-8 sentences each).
2.  **INTEGRATE DATA**: Every claim must be backed by a specific datapoint from `all_globals_schema`.
    -   *Bad*: "The market is growing."
    -   *Good*: "According to the Mordor Intelligence report (T003), the market is projected to reach $564M by FY29, driven by a 17.9% CAGR."
3.  **QUOTE THE SOURCE**: Extract direct quotes from `crawled_pages` or `search_results`.
4.  **ITERATE THE SCHEMA**: Do not just look at `summary_T###`. Look at `web_search_results_T###` and `detailed_analysis_T###`. extract the "nuggets" that the summary skipped.
- **Task Data > User Context**: If Task Data contains verified, recent facts that contradict `memory_context`, prioritize the Task Data.
- **User Context for Personalization**: Use `memory_context` to tailor the *tone*, *format*, and *focus* (e.g., "User prefers simple language" or "User loves tabular data").
- **Conflict Rule**: If Task Data explicitly contradicts Memory with *newer* verification (e.g. "User verified they now work at Google"), trust Task Data. Otherwise, trust Memory for user facts.
- **ANTI-HALLUCINATION**: If neither source has the answer, state "No Data Available".
- **Tone**: Professional, actionable, high-trust.

---

## ✅ OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON)
You must return a JSON object like:
```json
{
  "final_format": "markdown",
  "markdown_report": "Detailed markdown report",
  "call_self": true
}
```

## ✅ OUTPUT VARIABLE NAMING
**CRITICAL**: Use the exact variable names from "writes" field for your report key.

## User Preferences
User prefers: concise responses
Clarifications: minimize
Tone: no_motivational, direct
Avoid: It's not this, it's this, What you're describing is not

Also known as sakura, the cherry blossoms are not only a beautiful sight but hold deep cultural significance in Japan as well. They symbolize the transient nature of life and the beauty of impermanence.\nEvery spring, usually\nfrom late March to early April, cherry trees in Kyoto burst into beautiful pink and white blooms\n, creating a stunning landscape of delicate flowers. Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry blossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. Some gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical atmosphere.\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the fact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. However, with careful planning, you can make it happen! Thats why Ive put together this\nKyoto cherry blossom guide\n. Here youll find all the information Ive collected before and during my trip to Japan, including the exact sakura festival dates, night illuminations and the best cherry blossom spots.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Guide 2026\nSpring is magical in Kyoto. Every year,\nbetween late March and early April, thousands of cherry trees\ndecorate the citys ancient temples and serene gardens in beautiful pink and white colours. Its likely the most scenic time of year, but its fleeting,\nlasting just two weeks\n. Be sure to plan your visit carefully to catch it at its best.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Forecast 2026\nEvery year in January, the Japan Weather Association releases the cherry blossom forecast. This forecast provides information about when the flowers will begin to bloom and when they will reach full bloom across Japan.\nHowever, keep in mind that these dates are not final, because they depend a lot on the weather. Typically, if the weather is mild during the weeks before the sakura season, the trees tend to bloom earlier. Conversely, colder weather delays the blossoms from opening. The dates may shift either earlier or later (even up to 10 days), depending on weather conditions.\nIn recent years, the first blooms in Kyoto have been observed between March 17 and March 26. The full bloom typically reaches its peak between March 26 and April 4.\nThis year,\nthe first cherry blossoms in Kyoto will bloom on March 24, 2026\n, according to the data of the 4th forecast, released on February 5, 2026, by the\nJapan Weather Association\n.\nKyoto cherry blossom dates 2026\nForecasted flowering date  24 March 2026\nForecasted full bloom date  1 April 2026\nIn the table below, you can find the cherry blossom season dates for the last few years.\nYear\nFlowering date\nFull bloom date\n2025\n27 March\n5 April\n2024\n29 March\n5 April\n2023\n17 March\n27 March\nHow long do cherry blossoms last in Kyoto?\nTypically, the\ncherry blossom season lasts around two weeks\n. After the initial blossoms open up, it generally takes about a week to reach full bloom. A week later (depending on the weather), the blossoms start falling from the trees.\nKyoto cherry blossom locations\nYou can\nfind here a map\nof all popular cherry blossom viewing spots.\nTips for Kyoto sakura season\nAccommodation\n Kyoto is incredibly popular during cherry blossom season for both domestic and international travel. Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months ahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom forecast, which happens in January.\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\n:\nThe Gate Hotel\nWhy\n: perfect central location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\nWhat I like\n: cosy lounge with bonfire and free drinks, great city views\nBest time to enjoy sakura\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season in Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\nconsidering arriving a few days before the officially projected full bloom date\n(and staying a few days in Kyoto) to ensure you catch the blossoms at their best. In case the full bloom date is earlier, youll arrive exactly for it, if it is later  youll arrive just a few days before the opening (which is better than arriving after the full bloom when everything is gone).\nAlthough I booked my trip after the official sakura forecast, the latter changed so much because of warm weather, that the full bloom was 10 days earlier! I was lucky that I planned to arrive 3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I arrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started losing their pink petals. Five days later, nearly all of the blossoms were gone.\nVisiting Kyoto for the first time? Then have a look at my detailed\nKyoto itinerary\n, which includes all must-see sights, the best temples to visit and my favourite places for soba noodles.\nBest Kyoto cherry blossom spots\nIf youre planning a trip to Kyoto during the sakura season, youll find cherry blossoms pretty much everywhere.\nThe city boasts almost 50 cherry blossom viewing spots\n, including temples, gardens, paths, and canals (\nsee all locations here\n). There are, however, some places that offer a truly breathtaking experience that you wont want to miss. Youll find all of the must-see sakura spots in my guide, including some hidden and less crowded places.\nCertain locations, such as\nMaruyama Park and Hirano Shrine host cherry blossom festivals\nwith special events and sakura-flavoured food. While, others like Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Nij Castle, have stunning night illuminations of cherry flowers.\nBest cherry blossom in Kyoto 2026\nMaruyama Park\nPhilosophers Walk\nNij Castle\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nDaigo-ji Temple\nKiyamachi Dori\nNinna-ji Temple\nHeian Shrine\nKyoto Botanical Garden\nTji Temple\nHirano Shrine\nMaruyama Park\nThe weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park\nFounded in 1886, Maruyama Park is the oldest park in Kyoto. It is located next to Yasaka Shrine and the historic Gion district, known for its traditional tea houses and geisha culture.\nWith its 680 cherry trees, the park is one of the most popular cherry blossom viewing spots in Kyoto\n.\nMaruyama Park is most\nfamous for its\nmassive weeping cherry tree\n(shidarezakura). Towering over 12m (39 feet) in height and over 80 years old, it has grown from a parent tree over 200 years old. The tree is illuminated in the evenings during the sakura season, creating a magical and romantic atmosphere.\nYoull also find food stalls and vendors selling souvenirs and food in the park. A great place to taste some local treats, such as matcha soft serve!\nSakura festival in Maruyama Park\nMatcha soft serve\nDespite the crowds, I found Maruyama Park incredibly romantic, especially at sunset. I highly recommend it for couples.\nAddress: Maruyamacho, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto 605-0071, Japan\nClosest station: Gion-Shijo Station station (Keihan line)\nIllumination: from sunset (around 6 PM) to 10 PM\nEntry: free\nPhilosophers Walk\nThe Philosophers Walk is a must-see sakura spot in Kyoto\nPhilosophers Walk (also known as Tetsugaku-no-michi in Japanese) is one of the most popular sakura spots in Kyoto.

Also known as sakura, the cherry blossoms are not only a beautiful sight but hold deep cultural significance in Japan as well. They symbolize the transient nature of life and the beauty of impermanence.\nEvery spring, usually\nfrom late March to early April, cherry trees in Kyoto burst into beautiful pink and white blooms\n, creating a stunning landscape of delicate flowers. Thousands of tourists and locals flock to the citys popular cherry blossom viewing spots, such as Maruyama Park and the Philosophers Walk, to witness this fleeting beauty. Some gardens and temples even illuminate the cherry blossoms in the evenings, creating a magical atmosphere.\nPlanning a trip to Kyoto for the cherry blossom season could be tricky. This is because of the fact that every year the trees bloom at different times and the delicate flowers last only two weeks. However, with careful planning, you can make it happen! Thats why Ive put together this\nKyoto cherry blossom guide\n. Here youll find all the information Ive collected before and during my trip to Japan, including the exact sakura festival dates, night illuminations and the best cherry blossom spots.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Guide 2026\nSpring is magical in Kyoto. Every year,\nbetween late March and early April, thousands of cherry trees\ndecorate the citys ancient temples and serene gardens in beautiful pink and white colours. Its likely the most scenic time of year, but its fleeting,\nlasting just two weeks\n. Be sure to plan your visit carefully to catch it at its best.\nKyoto Cherry Blossom Forecast 2026\nEvery year in January, the Japan Weather Association releases the cherry blossom forecast. This forecast provides information about when the flowers will begin to bloom and when they will reach full bloom across Japan.\nHowever, keep in mind that these dates are not final, because they depend a lot on the weather. Typically, if the weather is mild during the weeks before the sakura season, the trees tend to bloom earlier. Conversely, colder weather delays the blossoms from opening. The dates may shift either earlier or later (even up to 10 days), depending on weather conditions.\nIn recent years, the first blooms in Kyoto have been observed between March 17 and March 26. The full bloom typically reaches its peak between March 26 and April 4.\nThis year,\nthe first cherry blossoms in Kyoto will bloom on March 24, 2026\n, according to the data of the 4th forecast, released on February 5, 2026, by the\nJapan Weather Association\n.\nKyoto cherry blossom dates 2026\nForecasted flowering date  24 March 2026\nForecasted full bloom date  1 April 2026\nIn the table below, you can find the cherry blossom season dates for the last few years.\nYear\nFlowering date\nFull bloom date\n2025\n27 March\n5 April\n2024\n29 March\n5 April\n2023\n17 March\n27 March\nHow long do cherry blossoms last in Kyoto?\nTypically, the\ncherry blossom season lasts around two weeks\n. After the initial blossoms open up, it generally takes about a week to reach full bloom. A week later (depending on the weather), the blossoms start falling from the trees.\nKyoto cherry blossom locations\nYou can\nfind here a map\nof all popular cherry blossom viewing spots.\nTips for Kyoto sakura season\nAccommodation\n Kyoto is incredibly popular during cherry blossom season for both domestic and international travel. Its highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance, ideally around 3-4 months ahead of your visit. My advice is to do it immediately after the release of the official cherry blossom forecast, which happens in January.\nMy favourite place to stay in Kyoto\n:\nThe Gate Hotel\nWhy\n: perfect central location with many dining options nearby, spacious rooms\nWhat I like\n: cosy lounge with bonfire and free drinks, great city views\nBest time to enjoy sakura\n In recent years, the cherry blossom season in Japan has started earlier than expected. Therefore, I recommend\nconsidering arriving a few days before the officially projected full bloom date\n(and staying a few days in Kyoto) to ensure you catch the blossoms at their best. In case the full bloom date is earlier, youll arrive exactly for it, if it is later  youll arrive just a few days before the opening (which is better than arriving after the full bloom when everything is gone).\nAlthough I booked my trip after the official sakura forecast, the latter changed so much because of warm weather, that the full bloom was 10 days earlier! I was lucky that I planned to arrive 3-4 days before the initial full bloom date, so I was still able to enjoy the sakura season. In the end, I arrived in Kyoto three days following the full bloom, and at that point, some trees had already started losing their pink petals. Five days later, nearly all of the blossoms were gone.\nVisiting Kyoto for the first time? Then have a look at my detailed\nKyoto itinerary\n, which includes all must-see sights, the best temples to visit and my favourite places for soba noodles.\nBest Kyoto cherry blossom spots\nIf youre planning a trip to Kyoto during the sakura season, youll find cherry blossoms pretty much everywhere.\nThe city boasts almost 50 cherry blossom viewing spots\n, including temples, gardens, paths, and canals (\nsee all locations here\n). There are, however, some places that offer a truly breathtaking experience that you wont want to miss. Youll find all of the must-see sakura spots in my guide, including some hidden and less crowded places.\nCertain locations, such as\nMaruyama Park and Hirano Shrine host cherry blossom festivals\nwith special events and sakura-flavoured food. While, others like Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Nij Castle, have stunning night illuminations of cherry flowers.\nBest cherry blossom in Kyoto 2026\nMaruyama Park\nPhilosophers Walk\nNij Castle\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\nDaigo-ji Temple\nKiyamachi Dori\nNinna-ji Temple\nHeian Shrine\nKyoto Botanical Garden\nTji Temple\nHirano Shrine\nMaruyama Park\nThe weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park\nFounded in 1886, Maruyama Park is the oldest park in Kyoto. It is located next to Yasaka Shrine and the historic Gion district, known for its traditional tea houses and geisha culture.\nWith its 680 cherry trees, the park is one of the most popular cherry blossom viewing spots in Kyoto\n.\nMaruyama Park is most\nfamous for its\nmassive weeping cherry tree\n(shidarezakura). Towering over 12m (39 feet) in height and over 80 years old, it has grown from a parent tree over 200 years old. The tree is illuminated in the evenings during the sakura season, creating a magical and romantic atmosphere.\nYoull also find food stalls and vendors selling souvenirs and food in the park. A great place to taste some local treats, such as matcha soft serve!\nSakura festival in Maruyama Park\nMatcha soft serve\nDespite the crowds, I found Maruyama Park incredibly romantic, especially at sunset. I highly recommend it for couples.\nAddress: Maruyamacho, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto 605-0071, Japan\nClosest station: Gion-Shijo Station station (Keihan line)\nIllumination: from sunset (around 6 PM) to 10 PM\nEntry: free\nPhilosophers Walk\nThe Philosophers Walk is a must-see sakura spot in Kyoto\nPhilosophers Walk (also known as Tetsugaku-no-michi in Japanese) is one of the most popular sakura spots in Kyoto.

But what exactly is kaiseki? It is a multi-course haute cuisine rooted in respect for seasonality, ingredients, presentation, and ritual.\nKaiseki is more than just food. Its an experience: the sequence of courses, the setting (tatami room, garden view, etc.), the aesthetic of plating, and the hospitality (omotenashi). All this combined makes for a truly elevated and unforgettable experience.\nWhile its true that some of the most prestigious kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto can cost upwards of 50,000 per person, the good news is this: you dont need to spend a fortune to experience it.\nIn this guide, well introduce you to 5 of the best budget-friendly kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto. These places strike the perfect balance between authenticity, atmosphere, and affordability.\nWhether youre a first-time visitor, a foodie on a budget, or simply curious about Japanese haute cuisine, you can savor Kyotos culinary heritage without emptying your wallet.\nWhat is Kaiseki?\nKaiseki () is Japans most refined form of\nmulti-course dining, often compared to haute cuisine in the West.\nOriginating in Kyoto, Kaiseki showcases the seasonality of ingredients\n, artistic presentation, and a balance of taste, texture, and appearance. More than just a meal, it is a cultural journey through Japanese hospitality (\nomotenashi\n) and aesthetics.\nOnce reserved for the nobility and tea ceremonies, kaiseki has evolved into an art form that celebrates seasonality, presentation, and the harmony of flavors. Each dish is prepared with meticulous attention to detail, highlighting the natural flavors of seasonal ingredients. Presentation, plating, and the sequence of courses are as important as taste, creating a dining experience that feels more like an art performance than just a meal.\nKey Features of Kaiseki\nSeasonal Ingredients (Shun):\nEvery dish reflects the current season, from springs bamboo shoots to autumns matsutake mushrooms.\nArtful Presentation:\nPlates are chosen to complement the food, creating a harmony of color, shape, and design.\nDelicate Balance:\nKaiseki emphasizes subtle flavors, ensuring no one element overwhelms the meal.\nCourse Flow:\nMeals usually progress from light dishes (like sashimi) to grilled, simmered, and steamed items, ending with rice and dessert.\nWhy is Kaiseki Special in Kyoto?\nKyoto is considered the birthplace of Kaiseki, influenced by Zen Buddhist tea ceremony traditions and the citys long history as Japans cultural capital.\nKyotos geography is unique, as it is surrounded by fertile valleys, mountains, and rivers. This provides chefs with an abundance of seasonal produce, freshwater fish, and mountain herbs, all of which shape their seasonal menus. The result is a dining experience that feels both timeless and deeply connected to nature, which are very important aspects of kaiseki.\nMany Michelin-starred restaurants and historic ryotei (traditional dining houses) in Kyoto serve kaiseki, making it the best place in Japan to experience this culinary art.\nTips for Choosing & Booking Kaiseki\nWhile on a Budget\nBefore we get into the kaiseki restaurants we recommend, lets discuss how to choose the best kaiseki restaurant for you, based on your budget, the season, and style.\nDepending on what kind of experience you want, here are things to think about:\nTime of Day\nLunch Kaiseki (or small courses) are often more affordable, less formal, and still excellent. Dinner is more elaborate.\nLocation & Atmosphere\nIf you want old Kyoto, geisha-district ambience, teahouse-y streets, gardens, pick places in Higashiyama, Gion, Arashiyama.\nMenu Seasonality\nTry to visit when ingredients are at peak (e.g. autumn mushrooms, winter fish etc.). Many top places only operate with certain courses during certain seasons.\nMake Reservations Early\nEspecially for the high end ones, youll often need to book weeks in advance. Some require contact by phone/email ahead.\nBook Early:\nBudget-friendly kaiseki spots are popular and often require reservations, especially on weekends.\nConsider Shojin Ryori:\nVegetarian temple cuisine is a unique, affordable alternative to traditional kaiseki.\nKeep an Open Mind:\nKaiseki is about subtle flavors, not bold seasonings. Approach it as a cultural experience as much as a meal.\nDress & Etiquette\nAs these establishments are for fine dining, please make sure to:\nRefrain from\nwearing casual clothes such as shorts or tank tops.\nRefrain from\nwearing sports or gym clothes, such as yoga pants or sweatpants.\nWear\nsocks. Many of these restaurants have you take your shoes off. Sandals are not allowed.\nRefrain from\nwearing strong perfume or cologne.\nIf you do not follow these rules, you\nmay be denied entry\nupon arrival.\nTop 5 Budget-Friendly Kaiseki Restaurants in Kyoto\nGion Maruyama ()\nWhy its great:\nGion Maruyama is a well-regarded kaiseki restaurant located in the heart of Kyotos historic geisha district. Known for its refined yet welcoming atmosphere, it offers a classic kaiseki experience without the intimidating price tag of ultra-high-end establishments like Kitcho. They are also a child-friendly restaurant, as they have a special kaiseki set just for children.\nCost:\nLunch courses start at around 18,000, offering excellent value for the quality. Dinner is more expensive (30,000+ depending on the season) but still reasonable compared to other top-tier dinner kaiseki courses.\nAtmosphere:\nTraditional tatami rooms and serene interiors make it ideal for an authentic Kyoto dining experience. This is the best experience if you want to balance budget, traditional atmosphere, and experience.\nLocation:\nConveniently located in Gion, making it easy to combine with sightseeing at Yasaka Shrine or Hanamikoji Street. You might even see a geisha on your way!\nReservations:\nReservations are highly recommended. Please\nvisit their website and reserve HERE\n.\nVisit\nGion Maruyama HERE\n!\nKinobu ()\nWhy its great:\nEstablished in the early 20th century, Kinobu is a family-run kaiseki restaurant that blends tradition with a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Unlike the ultra-formal establishments, Kinobu makes fine dining approachable while preserving authenticity. They also offer vegetarian kaiseki in the form of shojin ryori, or buddhist monk cuisine.\nCost:\nTheir traditional kaiseki dinner ranges from 17,60034,100 depending on the season. However, if youre aiming for a lower budget, they do beautiful Kyoto bento box lunches for 4,95010,800 depending on the season.\nAtmosphere:\nA calm, elegant setting with seasonal decor that reflects Kyotos rich cultural heritage.\nLocation:\nCentrally located near Shijo, making it convenient for travelers staying in downtown Kyoto.\nReservations\n: Reservations are recommended, especially for dinner. Please make a reservation via their phone number listed on\ntheir website HERE\nat the bottom of the site. (Have your hotel receptionist make the call if you would rather not talk on the phone, they would be happy to book for you.)\nVisit\nKinobu HERE\n.\nKikunoi Roan ( )\nWhy its great:\nThis is the younger sibling of the world-famous Kikunoi restaurant. While Kikunois main location in Higashiyama is a three-star Michelin restaurant and extremely pricey, Roan Kikunoi offers a more relaxed and affordable way to enjoy the same philosophy of seasonal cuisine while still being a two-star Michelin restaurant.\nBudget Tip:\nLunch courses start at\n14,500\n, a fraction of what youd pay at the flagship restaurant. Dinner courses start at 24,000.\nAtmosphere:\nModern, casual elegance, but still refined. We believe this is the best restaurant for those looking for a beginner-friendly",

In this article, the SAVOR JAPAN editorial team has carefully selected famous spots and nearby restaurants that are easy to incorporate into a night cherry blossom viewing itinerary. Reservations for the featured restaurants can be made through SAVOR JAPAN. Especially during the cherry blossom season, it is crowded, so securing a seat in advance allows you to fully enjoy a peaceful night in Kyoto.\n>> Best Spring Cherry Blossom Spots in Kyoto and Recommended Restaurants\n1. Kiyomizu-dera Temple\nAt the World Heritage Site Kiyomizu-dera, visitors can enjoy the magical collaboration of cherry blossoms at night and the temple buildings during the spring nighttime special viewing. The stage area and the slopes within the temple grounds bloom with Somei Yoshino and mountain cherry trees, which show a completely different majestic appearance when illuminated at night. The temple's varied elevations create a calming flow of people from the stage to the back, allowing for a serene cherry blossom viewing experience. There are also plenty of photo spots, including views looking up from beneath the stage and capturing cherry blossoms through the corridors. The nighttime viewing has limited periods and hours, and entry restrictions may apply, so it is advisable to check the official information in advance.\nKiyomizu-dera\nAddress:\n1-294 Kiyomizu, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture\nNearest station:\n- 10 minutes walk from 'Gojozaka' bus stop, accessed by bus from JR 'Kyoto Station' or Keihan Railway 'Gion-Shijo Station'\n- 10 minutes walk from 'Kiyomizu-michi' bus stop, accessed by bus from Hankyu Railway 'Kawaramachi Station'\nAdmission fee:\nAdults 500 yen, elementary and junior high school students 200 yen\nOpening hours:\n8:00 to 18:00 (reception closes at 21:00 during the spring nighttime special viewing period)\nLight-up time:\nApproximately 18:00 to 21:00 during the spring nighttime special viewing period\nTypical blooming period:\nEarly March to early April\nNumber of cherry trees:\nAbout 1,000\nRecommended Restaurants in the Vicinity | Miyagawacho Tensho\nA Japanese restaurant located in Miyagawa-cho.

The park features predominantly Somei Yoshino cherry trees, including the especially famous weeping cherry trees. At night, these trees are illuminated, creating a magical landscape. The central Gion weeping cherry tree exudes an overwhelming presence, and visitors can enjoy the changing expressions of the trees as they walk around and view them from different angles under the lights. The park is flat and easy to walk through, allowing for a pleasant stroll while admiring the cherry blossoms at night. Around 9 PM, the crowd usually thins, making it a good time for photography.

Our four-day Kyoto itinerary makes it easy. Quick Summary Heres how to break down four days in Kyoto Day One Arashiyama : Bamboo Forest, Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, Sagano Romantic Train, Monkey Park Day Two Higashiyama : Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka Koshida, Ryoken Kannon, Yasaka Pagoda Day Three Fushimi Inari and Gion: Fushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyotos Prettiest Road, Yanaka Shrine Day Four Temples and Tea : Kinkaku-ji, Yokai Street, Daruma Temple, Tea Ceremony, Pontocho This covers all of the main sights in Kyoto plus a few lesser-known sights and gives you a good feel for the city but if you want more detail, including some other spots you might not see in every other itinerary, keep reading. Article by Helen Foster. Disclosure: Some links in this post are affiliate links. See our Affiliate Disclosure. This plan is four whole days, so youll need to arrive in Kyoto early in the morning, or ideally, the night before, to hit the ground running. This is because this plan not only sends you around Kyoto but also tries to do it in a way that beats the crowds, which can be ridiculous at Kyotos biggest sights. Table of Contents [Open] [Close] Day One Arashiyama Day Two Higashiyama Day Three: Fushimi Inari and Gion Day Four: Temples and Tea Are You in Kyoto in Cherry Blossom Season? Day One Arashiyama Start your itinerary in this area packed with things to do while your feet are still in good shape! Arashiyama is in west Kyoto and easily reached by train. There are two central stations, Saga-Arashiyama and Arashiyama station, on the Randen line, and you can arrive at either of them for this plan. Start at Arashiyama Bamboo Forest As I explained in my post on how long to spend in Kyoto , one reason I suggest four days in Kyoto is to allow you to get to the big sights early and beat the crowds and, if you want to visit the Instagram-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and have a remote chance of getting a picture like the one below, youll want to go here first ideally before 8 am. The forest isnt that big, so if you do get here early and want to spend some time before the next stop on this plan, take a walk around Arashiyama Park at the end of the forest and the Observation Deck which gives you a look over the pretty Okochi Sanso Gorge. This is stunning in autumn dont miss it. Japlanease Favorite: Otagi Nenbutsu-Ji If the Bamboo Forest is not in your plans, start your day from this point. Find the closest bus stop to your station and jump on the 94 bus north for about 12-14 minutes to a shrine called Otagi Nenbutsu Ji. This is my absolute favorite place in Kyoto. Otagi-Nenbutsu Ji is a shrine full of tiny stone statues carved to look like tiny people and every single one is different. Some are serious, but there",

But crowds are not. Heres a great way to enjoy the best of Kyotos cherry blossoms while avoiding the worst of the crowds. Couple strolling under the cherries in Kyoto: Usa.Pin / Shutterstock.com Introduction Cherry blossom season (late March and early April) is a great time to come to Kyoto with that special someone. Sitting together beneath a cloud of perfect white blossoms is pure romance. However, without a little inside knowledge, youll more likely find yourself surrounding of selfie stick-wielding tourists jockeying for position beneath the best trees. Cycling under the cherries in Kyoto: weniliou / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, despite Kyotos newfound popularity, its still perfectly possible to enjoy the cherry blossoms without the crowds. You just need to go to the right places at the right times. Perhaps more importantly, you need to know what places to avoid. Heres the main thing: Avoid all of Southern Higashiyama during the day in cherry blossom season. In particular, avoid the section between Maruyama-koen Park and Kiyomizu-dera Temple . That whole section will be mobbed with people (but, in the evening, it will be beautiful and the crowds will have gone home). Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the evening during cherry blossom season: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com The best way to get some quality time with the cherries and your loved one is to follow this romantic cherry blossom itinerary. Not only have we designed it to avoid the crowds, weve also tried to make the transport easy, because there are few things less romantic than standing on a crowded bus trying to figure out where to get off. The route, sights and stations mentioned in this itinerary are all shown on our Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Map at the end of this itinerary. Romantic Cherry Blossom Itinerary Distance: About 5km on foot, plus two subway rides or taxi rides Time required: About six hours (four in the day, two in the evening) Sights: Kyoto Imperial Palace Park , Kyoto Botanical Gardens , Shoren-in Temple , Maruyama-koen Park , Kiyomizu-dera Temple Starting point: Imadegawa Station on the Karasuma Subway Line End Point: Kiyomizu-dera Temple Kiyomizu-dera Temple with cherries in full bloom: f11 photo / Shutterstock.com Note: Restaurants tend to be full right through the day in many areas during cherry blossom season. Rather than stressing about where to eat and waiting on line for a table, why not pack a picnic lunch? For some great choices, head to the food floor of Daimaru or Takashimaya department stores and pick up some really nice food to take with you? Both stores open at 10:00am. Kyoto Imperial Palace Park Start in the mid-morning. Take the Karasuma subway line to Imadegawa Station. Get up to street level and walk to the southeast corner of the intersection. Continue south on Karasuma and enter the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park (Kyoto Gyoen) via the first gate you come to (the Innui-mon Gate; ). Walk straight east (toward the mountains). You will soon come to a path leading in to a playground. There are some great cherry trees here. Then, continue east toward a small pond. Here, you will find some huge shidare-zakura (weeping cherry trees). These are some of the best in town. There will be people about, but there is plenty of space here to spread out. Weeping cherries at Kyoto Imperial Palace Park: zzz555zzz / Shutterstock.com Walk or Subway to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens After enjoying the cherries in the Imperial Palace Park, its now time to travel to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens . If the weather is good, you can easily walk this section. Its a three-kilometer walk that takes about an hour and youll see many bea",
