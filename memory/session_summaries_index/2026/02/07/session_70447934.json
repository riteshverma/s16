Batting first after winning the toss, India piled on a massive 411 for 9 in their 50 overs, driven by a breathtaking knock from Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8 The teenage opener smashed 175 off just 80 balls, hammering 15 fours and 15 sixes to completely dominate Englands bowling. Captain Ayush Mhatre added a composed half-century, while late fireworks from Kanishk Chouhan ensured India crossed the 400 mark. Chasing a daunting target, England fought hard but never truly got ahead of the asking rate. Ben Dawkins and Ben Mayes provided early resistance, while Caleb Falconer kept England alive with an aggressive knock of 115. However, regular wickets in the middle overs slowed the chase. Indias bowlers shared the workload, with Deepesh Devendran picking up multiple wickets and Ayush Mhatre and Kanishk Chouhan striking at key moments. England eventually finished on 311 all out in 40.2 overs, falling well short as India completed a dominant win to lift the trophy. The victory marks another milestone for Indias rich Under-19 legacy.

Batting first after winning the toss, India piled on a massive 411 for 9 in their 50 overs, driven by a breathtaking knock from Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8 The teenage opener smashed 175 off just 80 balls, hammering 15 fours and 15 sixes to completely dominate Englands bowling. Captain Ayush Mhatre added a composed half-century, while late fireworks from Kanishk Chouhan ensured India crossed the 400 mark. Chasing a daunting target, England fought hard but never truly got ahead of the asking rate. Ben Dawkins and Ben Mayes provided early resistance, while Caleb Falconer kept England alive with an aggressive knock of 115. However, regular wickets in the middle overs slowed the chase. Indias bowlers shared the workload, with Deepesh Devendran picking up multiple wickets and Ayush Mhatre and Kanishk Chouhan striking at key moments. England eventually finished on 311 all out in 40.2 overs, falling well short as India completed a dominant win to lift the trophy. The victory marks another milestone for Indias rich Under-19 legacy.

Batting first after winning the toss, India piled on a massive 411 for 9 in their 50 overs, driven by a breathtaking knock from Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8 The teenage opener smashed 175 off just 80 balls, hammering 15 fours and 15 sixes to completely dominate Englands bowling. Captain Ayush Mhatre added a composed half-century, while late fireworks from Kanishk Chouhan ensured India crossed the 400 mark. Chasing a daunting target, England fought hard but never truly got ahead of the asking rate. Ben Dawkins and Ben Mayes provided early resistance, while Caleb Falconer kept England alive with an aggressive knock of 115. However, regular wickets in the middle overs slowed the chase. Indias bowlers shared the workload, with Deepesh Devendran picking up multiple wickets and Ayush Mhatre and Kanishk Chouhan striking at key moments. England eventually finished on 311 all out in 40.2 overs, falling well short as India completed a dominant win to lift the trophy. The victory marks another milestone for Indias rich Under-19 legacy.
